Correlation -> association claims 
- correlation coeff
- pearson correlation
- 95% confidence 

- unknown causation direction 
- covariance?
- confounding variables?

- cross-lagged-panel 

- spurious correlation
- curvilinear association 
- 3rd variable?

Experimenting
- null results + effects

Experimental design 
	between-subject 
	within-subject 


true experiment - random assignment
