Intelligence is often defined as the ability to learn, reason, solve problems, and adapt to new situations. It can be described as the capacity to reason, plan, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and adapt to environmental challenges.

#### %% fold %% **Historical Background**

- **Francis Galton (1822–1911)**: Known for the statistical analysis of mental tests and studying individual differences in mental abilities. He emphasized measurement and variation in cognitive abilities among individuals.
- **Alfred Binet (1857–1911)**: Developed the **Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale** in 1905 to assess the intellectual aptitude of schoolchildren. Introduced the concept of **mental age**, which is the average cognitive ability of a child relative to their peers.
- **William Stern (1871–1938)**: Created the **intelligence quotient (IQ)**, calculated by dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100.
- **David Wechsler (1939)**: Developed the **Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)**, emphasizing both verbal and non-verbal abilities, which led to two primary subtests: verbal comprehension and performance tasks.

#### **Theories of Intelligence**

1. %% fold %% **General Intelligence (g)**: #studymore 
    - **Charles Spearman (1904)**: Introduced the concept of **general intelligence (g)**, suggesting that a single factor underlies all intellectual tasks. He also identified **specific skills (s)** for particular tasks.
2. %% fold %% **Fluid vs. Crystallized Intelligence**:
    - **Raymond Cattell (1971)**: Proposed that intelligence is composed of two distinct types:
        - **Fluid Intelligence**: The ability to reason and solve new problems without relying on prior knowledge (e.g., solving puzzles, abstract thinking).
        - **Crystallized Intelligence**: Knowledge that comes from prior learning and experience (e.g., vocabulary, general knowledge).
3. %% fold %% **Multiple Intelligences**:
    - **Howard Gardner (1983)**: Argued for multiple intelligences, suggesting that intelligence is not limited to just reasoning and problem-solving, but includes abilities in areas such as music, bodily-kinesthetic, and interpersonal intelligence.
4. %% fold %% **Triarchic Theory of Intelligence**:
    - **Robert Sternberg (1999)**: Proposed the **triarchic theory**, which identifies three types of intelligence:
        - **Analytical Intelligence**: Problem-solving and academic skills.
        - **Creative Intelligence**: The ability to think in new ways.
        - **Practical Intelligence**: The ability to deal with everyday tasks.
5. %% fold %% **Emotional Intelligence (EI)**:
    - **Salovey & Mayer (1990)**: Defined emotional intelligence as the ability to recognize, manage, and use emotions effectively. EI has been shown to correlate with social relationships and academic performance.

#### **Intelligence Testing**

- %% fold %% **IQ Tests**: Standardized tests are the most common method of measuring intelligence. IQ scores follow a **normal distribution** with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
    - **Stanford-Binet Test**: Measures general intelligence in children using tasks assessing memory, reasoning, and problem-solving.
    - **Wechsler Scales**: Includes tests for both children (WISC) and adults (WAIS). Tests consist of verbal and performance components.

	- **Reliability and Validity**: Intelligence tests are considered reliable if they produce stable results over time. They are valid if they accurately measure intelligence, correlating with life outcomes such as academic and job performance.

#### **The Psychometric Approach**

- %% fold %% **Factor Analysis**: This statistical technique groups related items on intelligence tests to identify underlying skills.
	- For example, a person who is good at math may also excel in logical reasoning.

- **General Intelligence (g)**: Spearman’s concept of a general factor that influences performance across various cognitive tasks.

#### **Beyond IQ: Other Types of Intelligence**

- **Creativity and Practicality**: Sternberg emphasized that intelligence is more than just solving academic problems; it also involves creativity and practical knowledge.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: As defined by Salovey and Mayer, it involves managing emotions and using them to guide thoughts and behaviors.

#### **The Roots of Intelligence: Genes and Environment**
#trytorecall 

- **Genetic Influences**: Studies have shown that intelligence is partly heritable, with twin studies demonstrating high correlations between identical twins’ IQs, even when raised apart.
- **Environmental Influences**: Intelligence is also shaped by the environment, including socioeconomic status, education, and access to resources. The **Flynn effect** highlights that IQ scores have risen across generations due to environmental improvements.

#### **Intelligence and Cognitive Performance**

- **Working Memory and Processing Speed**: General intelligence correlates with cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity and reaction time. Higher intelligence often means faster and more efficient cognitive processing.
