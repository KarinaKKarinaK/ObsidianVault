1. **Light Pathway**:
	- Light enters the eye through the **cornea** and passes through the **pupil** (regulated by the **iris**), then through the **lens** which focuses light onto the **retina** at the back of the eye.
	- **Rods** (low light, black/white perception) and **cones** (color perception, fine detail) in the retina transduce light into neural signals.
	- Neural signals travel through the **optic nerve** to the brain's **visual cortex**.

2. **Light Characteristics**:
	- **Intensity**: Refers to the brightness of the light (quantitative).
	- **Wavelength**: Determines the color of light (qualitative). Short wavelengths appear blue, long wavelengths appear red.

3. **Color Vision Theories**:
	- **Trichromatic Theory**: Proposes that color perception is based on three types of cones sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), and long (red) wavelengths.
	- **Opponent-Process Theory**: Proposes that color perception is controlled by opposing pairs of colors (red-green, blue-yellow). This explains afterimages, where staring at one color results in seeing its opposite when looking away.

4. **Sensory Adaptation**:
	- Decreased sensitivity to constant stimuli (e.g., not noticing the feel of clothes after wearing them for a while).
