**Small-N designs** 

- Psychophysics 
	- seen one - seen all
	- individual differences are negligible 
- Behaviour-change studies 
	- Stable-baseline design (AB)
		- A - during baseline
		- B - during / after treatment 
		- low on internal validity
	- Reversal design (ABA or ABAB) 
	- Multiple-baseline design (multiple subjects - introduce treatment at different times)
- Case studies 
	- (clinical population / patients)

- Aspects of small-N designs:
	- often trying to make causal claims
	- low internal validity
	- how well is stats, external and construct validity?

**Quasi-experimental designs** 

- Experimenter selects the variables rather than manipulates them 
	- Environment 
	- Subjects 
- Types of quasi-experimental designs:
	- Pretest / Posttest (AB design)
		- O1 - T - O2
	- Nonequivalent control group pretest / posttest design 
		- O1 - T - O2  (Experimental group)
		- O1 - - O2 (nonequivalent control group)

		- Matching 
			- groups should match in age / level of ---
		- Hawthrorne effect - presence the observer was increasing productivity 
	- Interrupted time-series design 
		- O1 - O2 - On - T - On+1 - On+2
		- Weak evidence: 
			- Continuation of a trend
			- Temporary effect 
			- Periodic fluctuations
		- Best possible evidence - where actually decreases 
		- It actually might be anything
	- Nonequivalent control group interrupted time-series design
		- There is a control group 
		- O1 - O2 - On - T - On+1 - On+2
		- O1 - O2 - On --- On+1 - On+2
	- Cross-sequential 
- Aspects of quasi-experimental designs:
	- aim to generate causal claims 
	- not high internal validity
	- question other validities also 

- No reliability -> no validity
