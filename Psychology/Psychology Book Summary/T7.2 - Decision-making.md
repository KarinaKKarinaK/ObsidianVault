Decision-making involves selecting one option from several possibilities. It often requires judgment under conditions of uncertainty, where information is incomplete or ambiguous.

### **Normative and Descriptive Decision Theories**

**1. Normative Decision Theories**

- %% fold %% **Expected Utility Theory**: Normative theories describe how people _should_ make decisions if they were perfectly rational. Expected utility theory suggests that decisions should be made to maximize the expected outcome based on the probability and value of different options.
    - For example, in a lottery with a ticket price of €10 and a 1 in a million chance of winning €1 million, the expected value (EV) would be calculated as:  
        **EV (buying) = ((1-10⁻⁶) * - €10) + (10⁻⁶ * €1,000,000) = - €9**  
        **EV (not buying) = €0**  
        Hence, rational decision-making suggests not buying the lottery ticket.

**2. Descriptive Decision Theories**

- These theories describe how people _actually_ make decisions, which often involves shortcuts and irrational judgments. Descriptive theories focus on biases, heuristics, and psychological influences that deviate from the ideal rational decision model.

### **Heuristics in Decision-Making**

Heuristics are mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making. While they allow for quick judgments, they often lead to biases and errors.

**1. Anchoring**:

- %% fold %% Anchoring refers to the tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information (the anchor) when making judgments.
    - **Example**: When asked to estimate the year the telephone was invented, participants gave different answers depending on whether they were first asked if it was invented before or after 1850 or 1920. The initial year served as an anchor, influencing their final estimates.

**2. Framing**:

- %% fold %% Framing describes how decisions are affected by the way information is presented.
    - **Example**: People are more likely to choose a sure option when a scenario is framed in terms of gains (e.g., saving lives) and to prefer riskier options when the same scenario is framed in terms of losses (e.g., people dying).
    - **Loss aversion**: People are more sensitive to potential losses than to equivalent gains, leading to risk-averse behaviors in loss contexts.

**3. Availability Heuristic**:

- %% fold %% The availability heuristic involves making decisions based on how easily information comes to mind. This can cause people to overestimate the frequency of events that are more memorable or recent.
    - **Example**: People may believe that airplane crashes are more common than they actually are because of media coverage, even though car accidents are statistically far more frequent.

**4. Representativeness Heuristic**:

- %% fold %% This heuristic occurs when people judge the likelihood of an event based on how closely it matches their existing prototype for the situation, ignoring other relevant information like base rates.
    - **Example**: When given a description of a person who is outgoing and concerned with social issues, people may assume the person is an activist, even if statistics suggest they are more likely to have a different profession.

**5. Affective Forecasting Heuristic**:

- %% fold %% Affective forecasting refers to the human tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of future events, both positive and negative.
    - **Example**: People may expect winning the lottery to make them much happier than it actually will, or they may overestimate how devastating a breakup will feel over time.

### **Risk Aversion and the Paradox of Choice**

**1. Risk Aversion**:

- %% fold %% People tend to prefer a sure gain over a risky gain and show heightened sensitivity to losses.
    - **Example**: Most participants will choose a 100% chance of gaining €800 over an 85% chance of gaining €1,000, even though the latter has a higher expected value.

**2. The Paradox of Choice**:

- When people are presented with too many attractive options, they can experience choice paralysis or dissatisfaction with the option they choose. This paradox suggests that sometimes fewer options lead to better decisions and greater satisfaction.

**3. Satisficers vs. Maximizers**:

- **Satisficers** are content with a choice that meets minimum criteria, while **Maximizers** strive to make the optimal choice. Satisficers tend to be more satisfied with their decisions, while maximizers may feel regret or dissatisfaction even after making seemingly better choices.
