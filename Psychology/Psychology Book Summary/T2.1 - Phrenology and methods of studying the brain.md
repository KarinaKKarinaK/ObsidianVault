## Phrenology

- **Origin**: Phrenology emerged in the **19th century**.

- **Theory**: It was based on the idea that **bumps on the skull** could be interpreted as indicators of personality traits and mental abilities.

	- **Practice**: By feeling the skull, practitioners claimed they could assess a person’s character and abilities.

- **Scientific relevance**: While considered a science at the time, **phrenology was later discredited** as a pseudoscience because it lacked empirical support. It did, however, popularize the idea that different parts of the brain have specific functions, which paved the way for modern neuroscience.

## Phineas Gage 

- **Incident**: Phineas Gage, a railroad worker, suffered a traumatic brain injury in **1848** when a tamping iron accidentally went through his skull, damaging his **frontal lobes**.

- **Effects**: Despite his initial physical recovery, Gage experienced a **significant personality change**. Once regarded as efficient and responsible, after the accident he became **impulsive, aggressive, and struggled with self-control**.


- **Significance**: This case provided early evidence that the **frontal lobes** play a crucial role in **personality, decision-making, and emotional regulation**. It demonstrated that specific brain regions are involved in regulating behavior.

## Methods of studying the brain 

Studying the brain involves **clinical observations** of patients with brain damage and **experimental techniques**.

**A. Clinical Observations**

- Involves observing patients who have suffered **brain injuries or illnesses** to infer the function of the damaged brain regions. For instance, Broca’s study on patients with speech impairments led to the identification of **Broca’s area**, responsible for speech production.

**B. Experimental Techniques**

1. %% fold %% **Invasive Techniques**:

	- **Animal Studies**: Involve **lesions** (destroying parts of the brain) and **single-cell recordings** to observe the effects on behavior and brain activity. These methods help understand brain functions by actively altering brain structure.

	- **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)**: Uses magnetic fields to **temporarily influence brain activity**, which allows researchers to study the **function of specific brain regions** by disrupting them temporarily without causing permanent damage.

2. %% fold %% **Electrophysiology**:

	- **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: Measures the brain’s **electrical activity**. It provides insights into **when** brain processes occur, but its **spatial resolution** (determining where in the brain activity happens) is less precise. EEG is particularly useful for **event-related potentials (ERP)** to understand **cognitive functions** like attention.

3. %% fold %% **Brain Imaging**:
	
	- **Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)**: Measures changes in blood oxygen levels to **map brain activity**. It provides a good **spatial resolution**, allowing researchers to see which brain regions are active during different tasks.

	- **Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**: Involves injecting radioactive tracers to measure brain activity based on **blood flow**. While useful, PET is less common now due to the requirement of radioactive substances.

  
**C. Comparison of techniques**

- **EEG** provides good information on **timing** but less on **location** of brain activity.

- **fMRI** and **PET** are better for pinpointing **where** in the brain activity happens, although **fMRI** is safer as it does not require radioactive substances like **PET**.
