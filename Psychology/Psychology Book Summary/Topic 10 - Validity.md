#### **Variables**

#trytorecall 

In psychological research, **variables** are the key concepts measured or manipulated to understand their relationships. Variables must have at least two levels or values. The major types of variables are as follows:

1. %% fold %% **Independent Variable (IV):**
    
    - The variable manipulated by the researcher to observe its effects on the dependent variable.
	    - Example: In a study about the effect of sleep on memory, sleep duration would be the IV.
2. %% fold %% **Dependent Variable (DV):**
    
    - The variable measured in an experiment to see the effect of the independent variable.
	    - Example: In the same study, memory performance would be the DV.
3. %% fold %% **Confounding Variable:**
    
    - A variable that confounds the results because it correlates with both the independent and dependent variables, providing alternative explanations for observed effects.
	    - Example: In a study on the effect of sleep on memory, caffeine consumption might be a confounding variable if it's not controlled.
4. %% fold %% **Control Variable:**
    
    - A variable that is kept constant to prevent it from affecting the outcome.
	    - Example: Temperature, testing time, or noise level during memory tests in a sleep study can be control variables.
5. %% fold %% **Conceptual Variable (Construct):**
    
    - The abstract concept that a researcher aims to study.
	    - Example: Intelligence, anxiety, or satisfaction with life.
6. %% fold %% **Operational Variable (Operational Definition):**
    
    - A specific method used to measure or manipulate a conceptual variable.
	    - Example: Measuring intelligence through IQ tests.
7. %% fold %% **Random Error:**
    
    - Unpredictable fluctuations in measured data that can affect the dependent variable. This noise can make detecting the true effect of the independent variable harder.
	    - Example: A participant's fatigue on the day of testing may randomly affect their performance.

#### **Types of Claims**

#trytorecall 

Researchers make three types of claims based on their findings:

1. %% fold %% **Frequency Claims:**
    
    - Describe a particular rate or degree of a single variable.
	    - Example: "39% of teens text while driving." This focuses on one measured variable and provides information about its frequency.
2. %% fold %% **Association Claims:**
    
    - Argue that one level of a variable is likely associated with a particular level of another variable.
	    - Example: "Coffee consumption is linked to lower depression in women."
    - **Correlation**: When variables move together, positive or negative. However, correlation does not imply causation (i.e., one variable causing the other).
        - Example: Positive correlation: More exercise is associated with higher income.
    - **Covariation**: Variables vary together, but without claiming causality.
3. %% fold %% **Causal Claims:**
    
    - Argue that one variable is responsible for changes in another variable.
	    - Example: "Pretending to be Batman helps kids stay on task."
    - Causal claims require strong evidence from experimental research to establish:
        1. **Covariance**: The cause (IV) and the effect (DV) must correlate.
        2. **Temporal Precedence**: The cause must come before the effect.
        3. **Internal Validity**: There should be no other explanations for the observed effect.

#### **Experimentation**

Experiments allow researchers to make causal claims by manipulating the independent variable and controlling other variables to observe their effects on the dependent variable. Key elements include:

- **Manipulation of the Independent Variable**: Controlling its levels to observe its effect on the DV.
- **Control Groups**: Essential for eliminating confounding variables. Control groups do not receive the treatment, allowing comparison with the experimental group.
