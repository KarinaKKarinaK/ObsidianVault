## %% fold %% What is psychology? And what is critical thinking? Why is that important?

- **[[Psychology]]**: The scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior.

	- **Mind**: Refers to mental activities such as thoughts, memories, feelings, and perceptions. The mind allows us to process the information we encounter through our senses.
	- **Brain**: The physical organ responsible for producing the mind. Psychological activities result from biochemical and electrical processes in the brain.
	- **Behavior**: Any observable action, whether verbal (e.g., talking) or non-verbal (e.g., walking, eating, etc.), that humans or animals engage in.

- **[[Psychology]] vs. Common Sense**: People tend to rely on **common sense** to understand behavior, but this often leads to **biases** and **errors** in thinking. Psychological science relies on empirical research to test ideas and hypotheses to avoid these biases.

- **Critical Thinking**: It is the systematic process of questioning and evaluating information using **well-supported evidence**. Critical thinking is essential because:

	1. **Biases in thinking**: People often overlook evidence that contradicts their beliefs (**confirmation bias**) or assume that correlation equals causation (**seeing patterns that don't exist**). Critical thinking challenges these biases.
	2. **Hindsight bias**: The tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that we knew the outcome beforehand. Critical thinking helps avoid the trap of oversimplified "I knew it all along" conclusions.
	3. **Mental shortcuts (Heuristics)**: People use shortcuts in thinking, which can lead to faulty conclusions. For example, assuming that events happening close together must be related.

  - **Amiable Skepticism**: A key trait of good scientists and thinkers. This involves being open to new ideas but also questioning the evidence before accepting them. It helps in distinguishing credible scientific findings from exaggerated or inaccurate claims. (same as critical thinking basically)


**Why Critical Thinking Matters**: 

- It helps us evaluate the validity of claims in everyday life. For example, the media often reports psychological studies with sensational headlines, but critical thinking allows us to dig deeper and question the quality and validity of the research behind the claims.

- **Self-awareness of bias**: People often cannot judge their own abilities accurately due to the **Dunning-Kruger Effect**, where people with limited knowledge in an area overestimate their competence because they lack the skills to assess their abilities accurately. 

	- For example, someone who is not skilled in singing may believe they are very talented and might even audition for a talent show, despite being tone-deaf.

## %% fold %% Key biases that distort thinking

1. **Ignoring evidence (Confirmation bias)**: People tend to focus on information that supports their beliefs and dismiss information that contradicts them. This can lead to skewed perceptions and decision-making. For example, if you believe in a specific diet, you might only read articles that support it while ignoring research that questions its benefits.
2. **Seeing causal relationships that don’t exist**: The human brain is wired to find patterns, but this sometimes leads to incorrect conclusions. For example, assuming that two unrelated events are linked just because they occur at the same time.
3. **Accepting after-the-fact explanations (Hindsight Bias)**: This is when we believe we "knew it all along" after an event has occurred, which can distort our understanding of why things happen. For example, after a sports game, people might believe that they could have predicted the winner all along.
4. **Mental shortcuts (Heuristics)**: These are quick, efficient rules that people use to make decisions, but they can often lead to errors. For instance, when making judgments about the likelihood of events, people tend to overestimate the likelihood of dramatic, highly reported events (like plane crashes) and underestimate common dangers (like car accidents).

## %% fold %% Historical foundations of psychology

- **Mind/Body problem**: One of the oldest questions in [[Psychology]]. Are the mind and body separate, or is the mind simply the brain's activity? Early views, such as **dualism**, suggested that the mind and body are distinct entities. However, modern [[Psychology]] rejects dualism, understanding that the mind arises from brain activity, and the two cannot be separated.

- **Nature vs. nurture debate**: This debate questions whether psychological characteristics are determined by biology (genetics) or by environment and experience. Modern [[Psychology]] agrees that both nature (genetics) and nurture (environment) interact in shaping human behavior and development.

## %% fold %% William James and functionalism

- **Functionalism**: A psychological approach introduced by William James that focuses on the adaptive purpose (function) of mind and behavior. James argued that the mind is too complex to break down into its individual parts, like emotions or sensory experiences. Instead, we should study the mind's overall function in helping humans survive and adapt.

- **Stream of consciousness**: James coined this term to describe the continuous flow of thoughts in the conscious mind. He believed that thoughts are ever-changing and cannot be reduced to fixed parts.

- **Natural selection and [[Psychology]]**: James applied Darwin's theory of natural selection to [[Psychology]], proposing that psychological processes evolve because they are adaptive and help humans survive. For example, behaviors like fear responses and social bonding are seen as adaptations that improve survival chances.

## %% fold %% Specializations in psychology and recent developments

[[Psychology]] has grown into many subfields, each focusing on different aspects of mind and behavior:

1. **Clinical [[Psychology]]**: Focuses on diagnosing and treating mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety). Clinical psychologists often work in therapeutic settings.
2. **Cognitive [[Psychology]]**: Studies mental processes like memory, perception, problem-solving, and learning. Cognitive psychologists explore how we process and store information.
3. **Developmental [[Psychology]]**: Looks at how people grow and change throughout life, from infancy to old age. Developmental psychologists examine milestones like language acquisition and emotional development.
4. **Health [[Psychology]]**: Investigates how psychological factors influence physical health. Health psychologists look at how stress, coping strategies, and behaviors like smoking or exercise impact overall well-being.
5. **Social-personality [[Psychology]]**: Focuses on how individuals’ personalities and social environments shape their behaviors. It examines factors like conformity, aggression, and interpersonal relationships.
6. **Industrial/Organizational [[Psychology]]**: Studies behavior in workplace settings, including how to improve productivity, employee satisfaction, and organizational structure.

Recent developments:

1. **Neuroscience**: Advances in brain imaging techniques, such as **fMRI**, allow researchers to see which brain areas are active during different mental tasks (e.g., decision-making, language processing). Neuroscientists study the **localization of brain functions**, which means specific areas of the brain are responsible for specific tasks.
2. **Genetics and epigenetics**: Modern research shows that genetics (our DNA) plays a role in behavior, but how genes are **expressed** can be influenced by environmental factors. **Epigenetics** studies how factors like stress, diet, and life experiences can turn certain genes on or off without changing the genetic code itself. For example, chronic stress can lead to the expression of genes associated with anxiety.
3. **Gut-brain axis**: Researchers have discovered that the **gut microbiome** (the microorganisms in our digestive system) interacts with the brain and influences mental health. This gut-brain connection is studied to understand conditions like anxiety, depression, and even autism.
