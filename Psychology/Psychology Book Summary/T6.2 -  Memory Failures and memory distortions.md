## When memory fails 

Memory is not always perfect. There are various ways in which memory can fail, leading to forgetting, distortions, or errors in recall. Understanding these failures helps in identifying why we might struggle to retrieve information at times or why our memories may be inaccurate.

1. %% fold %% **Forgetting**:

	• Forgetting can occur at any stage of memory processing—during encoding, storage, or retrieval. There are several reasons why we forget:
	
	• **Encoding Failure**: Information is never encoded into long-term memory. If attention is not paid to the details, they won’t be stored (e.g., failing to remember details of a common object like a coin).
	
	• **Storage Decay**: Memory traces weaken over time if they are not accessed frequently, leading to forgetting. This is illustrated by **Ebbinghaus’s forgetting curve**, which shows that forgetting happens rapidly after learning and then levels off.
	
	• **Retrieval Failure**: Memories stored in long-term memory are not always accessible. This is often due to the lack of appropriate retrieval cues.

2. %% fold %% **Interference**:

	• **Interference** occurs when similar information competes and interferes with the recall of other information:
	
	• **Proactive Interference**: Old information interferes with the recall of new information (e.g., remembering an old password makes it harder to recall the new one).
	
	• **Retroactive Interference**: New information interferes with the recall of old information (e.g., learning a new phone number makes it harder to remember the previous one).

3. %% fold %% **Absentmindedness**: #trytorecall 

	• **Absentmindedness** is a form of forgetting that results from lapses in attention during encoding. It is often the cause of everyday forgetfulness, such as losing keys or forgetting to perform tasks like locking the door.

4. %% fold %% **Blocking**:

	• **Blocking** refers to the temporary inability to retrieve information that is known to be stored in memory. This often occurs with names or words, commonly referred to as **the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon**. Even though you know the information, you can’t retrieve it at that moment.


## Memory errors

Memory is not a perfect recording of past events; it is reconstructive, meaning that we often fill in gaps based on expectations, schemas, or external influences. This can lead to memory distortions or even the creation of false memories.

1. %% fold %% **Memory Bias**:

	• **Memory bias** refers to the changing of memories over time to align with current beliefs, attitudes, or feelings. For instance, if someone’s view of a past relationship changes after a breakup, their memory of the relationship’s events may also be distorted.
	
	• **Flashbulb Memories**: These are vivid, detailed memories of significant or emotional events (e.g., where you were during a historical event like 9/11). While flashbulb memories feel highly accurate, research shows they are subject to the same errors and decay as other types of memories.

2. %% fold %% **Source Misattribution**:

	• **Source misattribution** occurs when you remember information but attribute it to the wrong source. For example, you might recall hearing a fact but misremember whether you heard it from a friend, a news program, or social media. This can lead to confusion and memory distortions.
	
	• **Cryptomnesia** is a specific type of source misattribution where you mistakenly believe a memory or idea is your own original thought when it was actually learned from another source. This sometimes leads to unintentional plagiarism.

3. %% fold %% **Suggestibility and the Misinformation Effect**: #studymore 

	• **Suggestibility** refers to the incorporation of misleading information into one’s memory after an event. This is especially problematic when individuals are exposed to biased or leading questions, which can alter their recollection of an event.
	
	• **The Misinformation Effect**: Demonstrated in studies by Elizabeth Loftus, this effect shows how people’s memories can be distorted by post-event information. For example, if witnesses to an accident are asked whether the cars “smashed” into each other (versus “hit”), they are more likely to recall higher speeds and broken glass, even if none was present.

4. %% fold %% **False Memories**:

	• **False memories** are recollections of events that never actually happened but feel real to the individual. They can be implanted through suggestion or through the process of reconstructing past events.
	
	• Repressed memories, especially traumatic ones, are controversial because of the risk that therapeutic techniques like hypnosis or leading questions can create false memories rather than recover genuine ones. Research has shown that memories can be easily distorted, especially if a person is repeatedly exposed to suggestions of events that didn’t occur.


## Amnesia


Amnesia refers to a deficit in long-term memory due to brain injury, disease, or psychological trauma. There are two primary types of amnesia:

---

1. %% fold %% **Retrograde Amnesia**:

	• Involves the loss of memories from before the brain injury. Individuals with retrograde amnesia struggle to recall events that occurred prior to the onset of amnesia but may still be able to form new memories.

2. %% fold %% **Anterograde Amnesia**:

	• Involves the inability to form new long-term memories after the brain injury. Anterograde amnesia is famously associated with the case of **H.M.**, a patient who lost his ability to form new memories after surgery to control his epilepsy. Despite losing the ability to form new episodic memories, H.M. could still learn new motor tasks (procedural memory), demonstrating the distinction between different memory systems in the brain.


## Improving memory 


Memory is not fixed, and various strategies can improve memory encoding, retention, and retrieval:

---

1. %% fold %% **Practice and Rehearsal**:

	• **Spaced Practice (Distributed Practice)**: Spreading out learning over time results in better retention than cramming (massed practice). Studying over multiple sessions gives the brain time to consolidate the information.
	
	• **Elaborative Rehearsal**: Making connections between new information and existing knowledge by explaining it in your own words or teaching it to someone else helps deepen encoding and improve recall.

2. %% fold %% **Mnemonics**:

	• Mnemonic devices, such as the **method of loci** (associating information with physical locations), **acronyms**, or **rhyming** techniques, can enhance memory by organizing information and linking it to already-known concepts or familiar structures.

3. %% fold %% **Retrieval Practice**:

	• Testing yourself on the material strengthens memory retrieval. Practicing recall without looking at the material helps to reinforce the neural pathways associated with the memory.

4. %% fold %% **Contextual and State Cues**:

	• Studying in an environment or emotional state similar to the one in which you will recall the information (e.g., during an exam) can improve retrieval. This principle, called **context-dependent memory**, leverages environmental or emotional cues to aid in recall.
