**Multivariate Correlational Research:** While bivariate correlations involve only two variables, multivariate research designs investigate the relationships between **more than two variables**. This allows researchers to address more complex questions about causality when experiments are not possible.

#### %% fold %% **Longitudinal Designs:**

Longitudinal studies measure the same variables in the same individuals over time. This design helps in establishing **temporal precedence**—one of the three causal criteria. For example, a longitudinal study might measure children’s narcissism and parental overvaluation over several years to establish which comes first​.

**Key Types of Correlations in Longitudinal Research:**

1. **Cross-sectional Correlations:** Measure the relationship between two variables at a single point in time. These correlations can show **covariance** but cannot establish temporal precedence.
2. **Autocorrelations:** Measure the consistency of one variable across different points in time. For example, researchers might measure parental overvaluation at different points to see if it remains stable.
3. **Cross-lag Correlations:** These test whether one variable measured at an earlier time point predicts another variable at a later time. This is particularly important in suggesting **temporal precedence**. For instance, does parental overvaluation at Time 1 predict narcissism at Time 2?

**Example:** In a study on parental overvaluation and child narcissism, the cross-lag correlation showed that overvaluation at an earlier time point predicted increased narcissism later​.

#### %% fold %% **Multiple Regression:**

Multiple regression is a powerful statistical technique that helps rule out **third-variable explanations**. In a multiple regression analysis, researchers can measure and statistically control for potential confounding variables, thus strengthening their argument that the relationship between two variables is **causal**.

1. **Key Terms:**
    
    - **Criterion Variable**: The dependent variable being predicted (e.g., narcissism).
    - **Predictor Variables**: Independent variables that are used to predict the criterion variable (e.g., parental overvaluation and time spent on social media).
2. **Example:** In a study on narcissism, researchers might control for factors like socioeconomic status and education to isolate the impact of parental overvaluation on narcissism​.
    

#### %% fold %% **Pattern and Parsimony:**

This approach involves using a **pattern** of results across multiple studies to support a **parsimonious theory**—the simplest explanation that accounts for all the data. 
	For example, multiple studies might find that overpraising children leads to narcissism. A parsimonious explanation is that overpraise causes narcissism, rather than other explanations like genetic predisposition​.

#### %% fold %% **Handling Null Effects:**

A **null effect** occurs when a study finds that the independent variable does not affect the dependent variable, which can happen for several reasons:

1. %% fold %% **Weak Manipulations:** If the manipulation of the independent variable is too subtle, it might not create a detectable change in the dependent variable. 
	For instance, if a researcher gives participants only small amounts of money ($0.25, $1.00), the manipulation might be too weak to influence happiness levels​.
    
2. %% fold %% **Insensitive Measures:** The dependent variable might not be sensitive enough to detect differences. 
	For example, if an online reading game improves children's reading skills by only a small amount, a basic pass/fail test might not pick up on this improvement.
    
3. %% fold %% **Ceiling and Floor Effects:** These occur when all participants score too high (ceiling) or too low (floor) on a dependent variable, obscuring any differences between groups.
    
    - **Example of Ceiling Effect:** Giving all participants an easy task results in everyone scoring very high, leaving no room to see the effects of the manipulation.
    - **Example of Floor Effect:** If all participants are given an impossibly difficult task, they all score very low, which also prevents researchers from seeing the true effects of the independent variable.

#### %% fold %% **Internal Validity in Experiments:**

Ensuring internal validity is critical in experimental designs. Researchers must be able to rule out alternative explanations for their findings. They do this by carefully controlling for potential confounds—variables that could provide an alternative explanation for the observed relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

1. %% fold %% **Design Confounds:** A confound occurs when another variable varies systematically along with the independent variable, potentially providing an alternative explanation for the results.
    
    - **Example:** If participants in a study receive different types of instructions depending on their condition, this difference could influence the results, introducing a confound​.

2. %% fold %% **Selection Effects:** These occur when the kinds of participants in one group systematically differ from those in the other group. Random assignment can help prevent selection effects.
    
    - **Example:** If one group consists of more highly motivated participants than the other, it could influence the results of the study​.

3. **Order Effects:** In within-subjects designs, participants are exposed to all levels of the independent variable. If the order in which they experience the conditions affects their performance, this can introduce a confound. Researchers use **counterbalancing** to mitigate this issue​.
