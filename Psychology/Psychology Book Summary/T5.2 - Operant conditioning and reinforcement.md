## Operant conditioning 


- Operant conditioning (also called instrumental conditioning) is a form of associative learning where the consequences of an action determine the likelihood of it being repeated​. Unlike classical conditioning, which involves involuntary responses, operant conditioning deals with voluntary behaviors.

### **Key Components of Operant Conditioning**

1. %% fold %% **Law of Effect (Thorndike)​**:
    
    - Behaviors followed by satisfying outcomes (reinforcements) are more likely to be repeated, while behaviors followed by unpleasant outcomes (punishments) are less likely to be repeated.

2. %% fold %% **B.F. Skinner's Contributions**:
    
    - Skinner expanded on Thorndike’s work by focusing on reinforcement and punishment.
    - **Skinner Box (Operant Chamber):** A controlled environment used to study how animals learn to associate specific behaviors with rewards or punishments.

## Reinforcement and punishment 

#trytorecall 

1. %% fold %% **Reinforcement**​:
    - **Reinforcement** increases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.
        - **Positive Reinforcement:** Adding a desirable stimulus to increase behavior (e.g., giving a dog a treat for sitting).
        
        - **Negative Reinforcement:** Removing an unpleasant stimulus to increase behavior (e.g., pressing a lever to stop an electric shock).

2. %% fold %% **Punishment**​:
    - **Punishment** decreases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.
        - **Positive Punishment:** Adding an unpleasant stimulus to reduce behavior (e.g., receiving a speeding ticket for driving too fast).
        
        - **Negative Punishment:** Removing a desirable stimulus to reduce behavior (e.g., taking away a teenager’s phone for breaking rules).

**Important Concept:** Positive means **adding** something (good or bad), and negative means **removing** something (good or bad)​.

### **Reinforcement Schedules**​

Operant conditioning can be influenced by how frequently and predictably reinforcement is provided. Reinforcement schedules describe how often a behavior is reinforced, and they can be either continuous or partial.

1. %% fold %% **Continuous Reinforcement**:
    
    - Every occurrence of the behavior is reinforced (e.g., giving a dog a treat every time it sits). This leads to fast learning but also fast extinction when reinforcement stops.
    
2. %% fold %% **Partial (Intermittent) Reinforcement**:
    
    Behavior is reinforced intermittently, making the behavior more resistant to extinction.
    
    - **Fixed Ratio (FR):** Reinforcement is given after a set number of responses (e.g., food after every 5th lever press).
    - **Variable Ratio (VR):** Reinforcement is given after a varying number of responses, based on an average (e.g., slot machines).
    - **Fixed Interval (FI):** Reinforcement is given after a fixed amount of time has passed since the last reinforcement (e.g., a paycheck every two weeks).
    - **Variable Interval (VI):** Reinforcement is given after a variable amount of time has passed (e.g., random drug testing).

**Partial reinforcement extinction effect:** Behaviors that are reinforced intermittently are more resistant to extinction than those that are continuously reinforced​.


## Shaping and superstitious behaviour 

Shaping is:
- %% fold %% a method used to train animals or humans to perform complex behaviors by reinforcing successive approximations of the desired behavior. 
	- For example, if you want to teach a dog to roll over, you might start by rewarding it for lying down, then rolling on its side, and eventually rolling over completely. Over time, reinforcement becomes more selective, rewarding only behaviors that are increasingly similar to the target behavior.

**Superstitious behavior** :
- %% fold %% occurs when a behavior is accidentally reinforced, leading the subject to repeat it. 
	- Skinner demonstrated this in pigeons: he gave food randomly, and the pigeons associated whatever behavior they were doing at the time (e.g., turning in circles) with the arrival of food, repeating the behavior even though it was unrelated to the food delivery​.

**Biological constraints on learning**:

Learning is not always unlimited. Both classical and operant conditioning are subject to biological constraints:

- **Instinctive Drift:** Animals revert to their instinctual behaviors after learning new tasks.
- **Biological Preparedness:** Certain associations (e.g., taste and nausea) are easier to learn because they have survival value​
