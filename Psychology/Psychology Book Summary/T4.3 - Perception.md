1. **Perceptual Organization**:

	- **Gestalt Principles**: The brain organizes sensory information into meaningful patterns using innate rules
		- **Proximity**: Elements close to each other are perceived as part of the same object.
		- **Similarity**: Objects that are similar in shape, color, or texture are grouped together.
		- **Continuity**: We perceive smooth, continuous patterns rather than discontinuous ones.
		- **Closure**: Our mind fills in gaps to create a complete object when part of the information is missing.
		- **Common Fate**: Elements moving in the same direction are perceived as part of the same group.

2. **Perceptual Constancies**:

	- The brain maintains a stable perception of objects despite changes in the environment or sensory input.
	
		- **Size Constancy**: Objects are perceived as the same size even when their distance from us changes and their retinal size varies.
		- **Shape Constancy**: Objects are perceived as having the same shape, even when viewed from different angles.
		- **Color Constancy**: The brain perceives colors consistently even under varying lighting conditions.
		- **Lightness Constancy**: The brain perceives the relative brightness of objects, keeping light levels consistent even with changes in illumination.

3. **Depth Perception**:

	- Depth perception enables us to see the world in three dimensions and judge distances.

	- **Binocular Cues**:
		- **Binocular Disparity**: The brain uses the slightly different images from each eye to perceive depth.
		- **Convergence**: As objects get closer, our eyes move inward to focus on them.
		
	- **Monocular Cues**:
		- **Occlusion**: A closer object blocks part of a farther object.
		- **Linear Perspective**: Parallel lines seem to converge in the distance.
		- **Relative Size**: Objects that are farther away appear smaller on the retina.
		- **Texture Gradient**: A textured surface appears to become denser and smoother as it recedes into the distance.
		- **Position Relative to Horizon**: Objects located below the horizon and appearing higher in the visual field are perceived as farther away.
		- **Motion Parallax**: Objects closer to the observer move faster across the visual field than those farther away.

4. **Motion Perception**:
	- Motion is detected through relative changes in the position of objects.
	- **Stroboscopic Movement**: The brain perceives motion when slightly different images are presented in rapid succession (as seen in movies).
	- **Motion Aftereffects**: If you look at a moving object for a long time and then look at a stationary object, the stationary object may appear to move in the opposite direction. This occurs due to neuron fatigue in the brain regions responsible for detecting motion in one direction.

3. **Visual Perception**:

	- **Bottom-Up Processing**: Perception starts with the sensory input and builds up to the brain’s integration of this information.
	- **Top-Down Processing**: Perception is influenced by expectations, experiences, and prior knowledge (e.g., recognizing words in a song that you have heard before).
	- **Context and Emotion**: The context of a situation and the emotions you bring to it can influence your perception of sensory information.

4. **Size Perception**:
	- The brain estimates the size of an object based on its distance. Optical illusions like the **Ames Room** and the **Ponzo Illusion** trick the brain into misinterpreting size due to manipulated depth cues.

**Important theories and models:**

1. **Trichromatic Theory**:
	- Proposes that color perception is based on three types of cones in the retina that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light: short (blue), medium (green), and long (red).

2. **Opponent-Process Theory**:
	- Suggests that color perception is controlled by opposing pairs of colors: red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white. This theory helps explain afterimages and why some color combinations (e.g., reddish-green) are not perceived.

3. **Two-Stream Hypothesis of Vision**:

	- Visual processing in the brain is divided into two streams:
		- **Dorsal Stream (Where Pathway)**: Processes spatial information about where objects are located.
		- **Ventral Stream (What Pathway)**: Processes information about what objects are, including their shape and color.
  

**Key Visual Perception Phenomena**:

1. **The Ames Room**:
	- An optical illusion where the room is designed to manipulate depth cues so that one person appears much larger than another, even though they are the same height.

2. **The Ponzo Illusion**:
	- Two horizontal lines of equal length appear to be of different lengths due to converging lines (e.g., railroad tracks) that provide misleading depth cues.

3. **Face Perception**:
	• The brain has specialized regions for processing faces, enabling us to quickly recognize and interpret facial expressions. People with **prosopagnosia** (face blindness) can recognize objects but struggle to identify individual faces.

4. **Object Recognition**
	- The brain organizes and interprets sensory data to identify objects using **bottom-up** (data-driven) and **top-down**(knowledge-driven) processes.
