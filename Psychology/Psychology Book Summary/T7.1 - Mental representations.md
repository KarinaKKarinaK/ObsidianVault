Mental representations are internal depictions of information that enable us to understand the world and store knowledge. These can be split into two categories:

- %% fold %% **Analogical Representations**: These representations are mental images that have some characteristics of the actual objects they represent. For example, a map is an analogical representation of the layout of a geographical area.
	- More concrete and tied to sensory experiences. 

- %% fold %% **Symbolic Representations**: These are abstract representations like words or numbers that do not directly resemble the physical objects they refer to. For example, the word “violin” doesn’t physically resemble the instrument itself, but we understand the meaning.
	- More abstract, relying on rules or language. 


**Mental Maps and Errors**


- **Mental Maps**: These are representations that include both analogical and symbolic elements. For example, a mental map of a country’s layout might be a mix of remembered visuals and symbolic distances.

- Common errors arise from over-reliance on symbolic knowledge. 
	- For instance, many people incorrectly believe that San Diego is farther west than Reno due to their symbolic understanding of California and Nevada’s positions on a map, when in fact Reno is farther west.

**Categorization**

**1. Prototype Theory (Rosch, 1973):**

- **Prototype**: This theory posits that category membership depends on the degree to which an object is similar to a prototypical example of the category. 
	- A prototype is the “average” representation of the category, such as an orange being the prototype for the fruit category. Items closer to the prototype are categorized more easily.

- **Exemplar Theory (Nosofsky, 1986)**: Unlike prototypes, exemplar theory suggests that we compare new stimuli with all examples we have encountered before (exemplars). If a new object is similar to many previous examples, it is typical of the category; if not, it is atypical.

**2. The Role of Concepts**

- **Concepts**: Mental groupings of similar objects, events, or ideas. They allow us to categorize and organize information more efficiently. For example, the concept of “dog” allows us to categorize all dog breeds under one mental representation, even though individual dogs may vary significantly.
