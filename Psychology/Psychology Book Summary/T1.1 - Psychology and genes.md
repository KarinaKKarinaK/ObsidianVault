## What is psychological science? 

- **Psychological Science**: The scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior. 
- The mind encompasses mental activities like thoughts, memories, perceptions, and emotions. 
- The brain is the physical organ responsible for these activities, while behavior includes all observable actions of humans and animals.

**Why Psychology is Important**?
  
- **Biases and common sense**: Humans are naturally intuitive and often rely on biases (e.g., confirmation bias, hindsight bias, or mental shortcuts) to make decisions or judge situations. These biases can lead to incorrect conclusions. Psychology uses empirical research and data to minimize such errors.

- **Nature vs. nurture debate**: Central to psychology is the question of how much human behavior is influenced by genetics (nature) versus environment and experience (nurture). Modern psychology agrees that both genetics and environment continuously interact to shape who we are.

## %% fold %% Gene expression and the role of the environment

- **Gene expression**: Genes, which are units of heredity, do not automatically dictate traits. They must be expressed (activated) for their effects to be visible. This expression is regulated by various factors:

	- Biochemical environment inside the cell.
	- Environmental influences (e.g., stress, nutrition, social experiences).
	- Timing in development (when genes are expressed is crucial; some genes are active only at specific stages of life).

- **Methylation**: A biochemical process that can affect gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA, modifying the activity of the gene without changing its structure. For example, environmental stress can increase methylation, potentially suppressing the expression of certain genes.

- **Epigenetics**: Studies how environmental factors can influence gene expression without changing the genetic code itself. For example, a stressful upbringing might activate genes that predispose a person to anxiety or depression, but supportive environments can reverse or modify these expressions. Environmental triggers like stress, nutrition, or life experiences can modify gene expression across generations.

-  **Environmental influence on gene expression**: While all cells in the body contain the same genes, external factors such as diet, temperature, or social interactions can trigger specific genes to turn on or off, influencing traits and behaviors. This concept is crucial in understanding how psychological traits and behaviors develop.

## %% fold %% Genome, genotype, and phenotype

- **Genome**: Refers to the entire set of genes in an organism. It acts as a blueprint that contains the instructions for building and maintaining the body.

- **Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an individual, determined at conception. It remains constant throughout life.

- **Homozygous vs. heterozygous**: When an individual has two identical alleles for a particular gene, they are **homozygous**. If they have two different alleles, they are **heterozygous**.


- **Phenotype**: The observable traits and behaviors of an individual, resulting from the interaction between genotype and the environment. For example, height is determined by genetic factors (genotype) but can be influenced by nutrition (environment).

- **Polygenic Traits**: Most human traits (e.g., intelligence, height) are polygenic, meaning they are **influenced by multiple genes** and environmental factors. This explains the wide variation in human characteristics, which cannot be attributed to a single gene.

- **Alleles**: Variants of genes. Humans have two copies of each gene (one from each parent). These alleles can be either dominant (one copy needed to be expressed) or recessive (two copies needed for the trait to be expressed). Combinations of dominant and recessive alleles contribute to genetic diversity. 

## %% fold %% Heritability and genetic influence on traits

- **Heritability estimate**: A statistical measure of how much of the variation in a trait within a population is due to genetics. Heritability ranges from 0 to 1:

	- A score closer to 1 means that genetic factors are more responsible for the variation in that trait.
	- A score closer to 0 suggests that environmental factors play a larger role.


- **Important considerations**: Heritability applies to populations, not individuals. It doesn't mean that an individual's traits are fixed by genetics but refers to the population-level influence of genetics. For example, a heritability score of 0.6 for intelligence means that 60% of the variation in intelligence within that population is due to genetic differences, not that an individual's intelligence is 60% genetic.

## %% fold %% The basics of behavioral genetics

- **Behavioral genetics**: This field studies the interaction between genetics and environment to explain behavior. Researchers use:

	- **Twin studies**: Monozygotic (identical) twins share 100% of their genes, while dizygotic (fraternal) twins share about 50%. If identical twins show more similarity in traits than fraternal twins, it suggests a genetic influence.

	- **Adoption Studies**: These compare adopted children to both their biological and adoptive parents. Traits that resemble biological parents suggest genetic influence, while resemblance to adoptive parents suggests environmental influence.


- **Gene-environment interaction**: Genes can influence the environments people choose (e.g., extroverted individuals may seek social environments). Similarly, environments can influence how genes are expressed (e.g., a stressful environment may trigger the expression of genes related to anxiety or aggression). This dynamic interaction highlights that neither genes nor environment act in isolation.

	- **Example**: The **MAOA gene** is linked to aggression, particularly in individuals who experienced childhood abuse or neglect, demonstrating the complex relationship between genetics and environment.

## %% fold %% Darwin’s theory of evolution and natural selection + evidence supporting evolution

- **Natural selection**: The core mechanism of Darwin's evolutionary theory. Traits that improve survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on. Three essential conditions for natural selection are:

#trytorecall 
	1. **Variation**: Individuals in a population vary in traits (e.g., size, strength).
	2. **Differential survival and reproduction**: Some individuals, due to their traits, are more likely to survive and reproduce.
	3. **Heritability**: These advantageous traits must be inheritable and passed on to the next generation.

- **Survival of the Fittest**: The key is not necessarily the survival of the strongest but the survival of the genes. Traits that improve gene survival (e.g., social cooperation, reproductive success) are more likely to persist.

- **Genetic Mutations**: Mutations introduce genetic diversity, which is crucial for evolution. Some mutations are beneficial (e.g., disease resistance), while others may be harmful (e.g., genetic disorders). Beneficial mutations can provide a survival advantage, allowing these traits to persist through natural selection.

- **Sex Chromosomes**: Males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), while females have two X chromosomes (XX). The presence of the Y chromosome determines male biological characteristics. These sex chromosomes are responsible for not only gender determination but also the inheritance of certain traits, like color blindness, which is more common in males due to the single X chromosome.


**Evidence Supporting Evolution**

- **Fossil Record**: Shows gradual changes in species over millions of years, supporting the idea of common ancestry.
- **Comparative Genetics**: Many species, including humans, share a significant percentage of their genes. For example, humans share about 98% of their DNA with chimpanzees.
- **Pseudogenes**: Non-functional DNA sequences that are remnants of previously active genes, showing evolutionary history.
- **Geographical Distribution of Species**: Similar species are often found in areas that were once connected, like continental islands, supporting the theory of shared ancestry.

## %% fold %% Evolutionary psychology

- **Evolutionary Psychology**: Focuses on how evolutionary processes like natural selection shape psychological traits and behaviors. For instance, behaviors that helped early humans survive (like forming social bonds) are still part of human psychology today.

- **Brain development and evolution**: The human brain evolved to adapt to complex social environments, which is why we have advanced capacities for communication, problem-solving, and cooperation.

## %% fold %% Brain development and plasticity

- **Postnatal brain development**: The brain undergoes significant growth and reorganization after birth. Experiences during this period are critical in shaping brain development.

	- **Example**: Rats raised in enriched environments (with toys and companions) have thicker cortices than those raised in isolation, demonstrating the brain's ability to adapt to its environment.

- **Sensitive periods**: Certain periods in development, especially in early childhood, are critical for brain development. If a child does not receive appropriate stimulation during these periods (e.g., language exposure), it can lead to permanent deficits in those areas.


- **MAOA gene and aggression**: Research has shown that individuals with a variant of the MAOA gene, often referred to as the "warrior gene," may be more susceptible to developing aggressive behaviors, particularly if they experienced abuse or neglect in childhood. This highlights the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental triggers.

## %% fold %% The role of culture in behavior

- **Individualism vs. collectivism**: Cultures can generally be categorized as individualistic (prioritizing personal goals) or collectivistic (prioritizing group goals). However, there is often variation within cultures, and no culture is purely one or the other.

- **Cultural evolution**: Cultural norms and behaviors evolve over time, much like biological traits. For example, certain religious or social practices may have initially developed as adaptive responses to environmental challenges (e.g., prohibitions on eating pork in desert cultures).
