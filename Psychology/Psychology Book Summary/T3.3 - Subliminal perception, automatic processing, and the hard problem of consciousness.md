## Subliminal perception and unconscious influence

- %% fold %% **Subliminal Perception** occurs when stimuli are processed by the sensory systems but do not reach consciousness due to their short duration or subtle nature. This phenomenon raises the question of how much influence subliminal cues can have on behavior. Research indicates that subliminal cues may have modest effects, especially on motivation and emotion .

	- For example, flashing the word "thirst" subliminally has been shown to increase the amount of liquid consumed by participants, especially if they were already thirsty .

- %% fold %% **Priming** is another form of unconscious influence where exposure to one stimulus affects the response to a subsequent stimulus, even without conscious awareness. 
	- For example, seeing the word "chair" makes it easier to recognize related words like "table" .

## Automatic vs. controlled processing

%% fold %% **Automatic Processing** refers to tasks that become so well-learned that they require little conscious effort. 
	- For instance, once someone becomes proficient at driving, they can drive while carrying on a conversation, with much of the task being handled unconsciously .

- %% fold %% **Controlled Processing**, by contrast, requires conscious effort and attention, especially when learning new or complex tasks. 
	- For example, learning to knit or solve complex math problems initially requires a lot of focus, but with practice, these tasks can become more automatic .

The **Stroop Effect** demonstrates the cost of automatic processing. When participants are asked to name the color of ink in which words are printed (such as the word "red" printed in blue ink), they struggle because reading the word is automatic, while naming the ink color requires more conscious control .

## Hard problem of consciousness 

- The **Hard Problem of Consciousness**, proposed by philosopher David Chalmers, concerns the difficulty of explaining how and why subjective experiences (qualia) arise from physical processes in the brain .

- **Qualia** are the individual instances of subjective, conscious experience, such as what it feels like to see the color red or taste sweetness.

## Divided consciousness and the brain

- Studies on **split-brain patients**, where the corpus callosum (connecting the brain's two hemispheres) is severed, reveal that consciousness can be divided. In these patients, each hemisphere can function independently, leading to situations where one side of the brain may perform tasks without the conscious awareness of the other .
