## Brain structure 

The brain is composed of various regions, each responsible for different cognitive and physiological functions. It is divided into the following major parts:

**A. Cerebral Cortex**

#trytorecall 

- The **cerebral cortex** is the **outer layer** of the brain, responsible for higher-level processes like thought, perception, and decision-making.
- **Gray matter** (consisting of neuron cell bodies) and **white matter** (consisting of myelinated axons) make up the structure of the cortex.

**B. Lobes of the Brain**

Each hemisphere of the cerebral cortex is divided into four lodrubes, each associated with different functions:

1. **Frontal Lobe**:
	- Located at the **front** of the brain.
	- Responsible for **planning, decision-making, personality, and movement**.
	- The **motor cortex**, located at the back of the frontal lobe, is responsible for **voluntary movement**.
	- **Broca’s area**, located in the left frontal lobe, is critical for **speech production**.

2. **Parietal Lobe**:
	- Located behind the frontal lobe.
	- Processes **sensory information** such as **touch** and spatial relationships.
	- The **somatosensory cortex** is responsible for processing tactile information like pressure, temperature, and pain.
	- Involved in **attention** and **spatial awareness**.

3. **Temporal Lobe**:
	- Located on the sides of the brain, near the ears.
	- Responsible for **hearing, memory, and language comprehension**.
	- **Wernicke’s area**, located in the left temporal lobe, is essential for **language comprehension**.
	- Contains the **fusiform face area**, which is crucial for recognizing faces.

4. **Occipital Lobe**:
	- Located at the **back** of the brain.
	- Responsible for **visual processing**.
	- The **primary visual cortex** in the occipital lobe processes incoming visual information, including shape, color, and motion.

## Subcortical structures 

Beneath the cerebral cortex, several subcortical structures contribute to various aspects of behavior and emotion:

#trytorecall 

**A. Thalamus**
- The **thalamus** is the brain's **relay station** for sensory information, directing sensory signals to the appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex (except for smell).
- It plays a crucial role in **attention** and **awareness**.

**B. Hypothalamus**
- The **hypothalamus** is a small structure involved in maintaining **homeostasis** by regulating vital functions like **temperature, hunger, thirst**, and **emotions**.
- It also controls the **endocrine system** by influencing the release of hormones from the **pituitary gland**.

**C. Hippocampus**
- The **hippocampus** is crucial for the formation of **new memories** and spatial navigation.
- Damage to the hippocampus can impair the ability to form new **long-term memories**, though older memories remain intact.

**D. Amygdala**
- The **amygdala** is involved in **emotional processing**, particularly **fear** and **aggression**.
- It plays a key role in forming emotional memories and influences behavior based on those emotions.

**E. Basal Ganglia**
- The **basal ganglia** are a group of structures that play a key role in **movement regulation** and **reward processing**.
- Disorders of the basal ganglia, such as **Parkinson’s disease**, result in motor control issues due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons.

## Motor and sensory cortex + association ares

#trytorecall 

- The **motor cortex** (located in the **frontal lobe**) controls **voluntary movements**. Different areas of the motor cortex correspond to different parts of the body, with larger areas devoted to body parts that require finer motor control (e.g., hands, mouth).

- The **somatosensory cortex** (located in the **parietal lobe**) processes **sensory information** such as touch, pressure, and temperature. Like the motor cortex, it is organized in a way that body parts requiring greater sensitivity occupy more space.

Association Areas

- **Association areas** are regions of the cerebral cortex that integrate and link sensory and motor information with stored memories.

- These areas are involved in higher-level cognitive functions such as **thinking**, **planning**, and **problem-solving**.

- The more **intelligent** an organism, the larger its association areas.
