## Neurotransmitters 


- Neurotransmitters are **chemical messengers** that allow neurons to communicate with each other across synapses. They bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron and can generate either **excitatory** or **inhibitory** signals.

**A. Types of Neurotransmitters and Their Functions**

1. %% fold %% **Acetylcholine (ACh)**:
	- **Function**: Involved in **motor control**, particularly in the junction between nerves and muscles. It also plays a role in **learning, memory**, and **sleep**.
	- **Disorders**: Low levels are associated with **Alzheimer’s disease**.

2. %% fold %% **Norepinephrine**:
	- **Function**: Responsible for **arousal, vigilance**, and attention. It plays a role in the body's fight-or-flight response.

3. %% fold %% **Serotonin**:
	- **Function**: Regulates **mood**, emotional states, and impulsiveness. It is also involved in **sleep** and **dreaming**.
	
	- **Disorders**: Low levels of serotonin are linked to **depression**, and **SSRIs** (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are commonly used to treat depression by increasing serotonin levels in the synapse.

4. %% fold %% **Dopamine**:
	- **Function**: Involved in **reward, motivation**, and motor control over voluntary movement.
	
	- **Disorders**: Imbalances are associated with **Parkinson’s disease** (low dopamine) and **schizophrenia** (high dopamine). Parkinson's is treated with **L-DOPA**, which increases dopamine production.

5. %% fold %% **GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)**:
	- **Function**: The primary **inhibitory** neurotransmitter, preventing excessive neural firing.
	
	- **Disorders**: Low GABA activity is linked to **anxiety**. Drugs that enhance GABA activity, like **benzodiazepines**, are used to reduce anxiety.

6. %% fold %% **Glutamate**:
	- **Function**: The primary **excitatory** neurotransmitter, involved in **learning** and **memory**.
	
	- Excessive glutamate release can lead to **excitotoxicity**, which is damaging to neurons and can result in conditions like **stroke**.

7. %% fold %% **Endorphins**:
	- **Function**: Involved in **pain reduction** and **reward**. These neurotransmitters are released during activities such as exercise, leading to the “runner’s high.”
	
	- **Drugs**: Opiates (such as morphine) mimic endorphins and bind to the same receptors to reduce pain.

## Drugs and their effects 


Drugs can **enhance** or **inhibit** neurotransmitter activity by acting as **agonists** or **antagonists**.

**A. Agonists**
-  Drugs that **enhance** the effects of neurotransmitters by either increasing the production or preventing their reuptake.

- **Examples**:
	- **SSRIs**: These drugs **increase serotonin** levels by blocking its reuptake, commonly used to treat depression.
	- **L-DOPA**: A precursor to dopamine used to treat **Parkinson’s disease**, it boosts dopamine production.

**B. Antagonists**
- Drugs that **inhibit** neurotransmitter action by blocking receptors or enhancing the breakdown of neurotransmitters.

- **Examples**:
	- **Antipsychotic drugs**: These block dopamine receptors, which is useful in treating **schizophrenia** by reducing dopamine activity.

**C. Effects of Drugs on the Nervous System**

- **Psychoactive drugs** can mimic or interfere with the activity of neurotransmitters. For instance, **heroin** mimics the action of **endorphins**, while **cocaine** prevents the reuptake of **dopamine**, leading to elevated dopamine levels and feelings of euphoria.

- **Addiction** often arises from the brain’s **reward system** being overstimulated by drugs, leading to changes in how dopamine circuits operate.
