**Single-factor design**

- Levels of Independent variables
	- between-subj design
		- no carry-over / practice effect
		- BUT: chance that groups differ
			- random assignment / matching
	- within-subj design
		- no group differences 
		- BUT: order effects 
			- counterbalancing

**Factorial designs** 

- multiple IVs 
	- independent of each other 
- 2 * 3
	- between-subj (6 groups for 6 conditions)
	- within-subj (6 sequences for 6 conditions)
	- mixed design 
- 2 * 2 * 2 
	- split into 2 tables 

- Advantages / Disadvantages of factorial designs 
	- more efficient (1 experiment instead of 2)
	- generalisation
	- interaction effect
	- BUT: reduces power
	- bigger sample needed

- Effects in factorial designs
	- **main effect** (average another IV)
	- interaction effect
