## %% fold %% Auditory sense 

1. %% fold %% **How We Hear**:

	- Hearing (or **audition**) begins with changes in **air pressure** caused by vibrations. These changes form **sound waves**, which travel through the air and reach the ear.
	
	- **Outer Ear**: Sound waves enter through the outer ear and travel through the **auditory canal** to reach the **eardrum**, a membrane that vibrates with the sound waves.
	
	- **Middle Ear**: Vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted via three tiny bones known as the **ossicles** (the hammer, anvil, and stirrup) to the **oval window**, a membrane that leads into the cochlea.
	
	- **Inner Ear (Cochlea)**: The **cochlea** is a fluid-filled structure in the inner ear where vibrations create pressure waves that move the **basilar membrane**. Hair cells along this membrane transduce mechanical signals into electrical impulses, which travel along the **auditory nerve** to the brain.
	
	- **Sound Waves**:
		- **Amplitude** determines **loudness** (larger amplitudes produce louder sounds).
		- **Frequency** determines **pitch** (higher frequencies result in higher-pitched sounds).
## %% fold %% Vestibular sense 

#trytorecall 

- The **vestibular sense** provides our sense of balance and spatial orientation. It relies on the **semicircular canals** in the inner ear, which detect head movements.

- When the head moves, the fluid in the semicircular canals shifts, causing **hair cells** to bend, which sends signals to the brain about the body’s orientation.

- This sense is critical for balance and is responsible for sensations like dizziness or motion sickness when disrupted.

## %% fold %% **Kinaesthesia**:

The sense of body position and movement of limbs, relying on sensory receptors in muscles, tendons, and joints.

## %% fold %% Pitch perception 

- **Temporal Coding**: Low-frequency sounds are encoded by the firing rate of auditory neurons. For instance, a 1,000 Hz sound causes hair cells to fire at a rate of 1,000 times per second.

- **Place Coding**: High-frequency sounds are encoded by the location of stimulation on the **basilar membrane** in the cochlea. Different frequencies activate different regions of the membrane.


##  %% fold %% Taste (Gustation)

1. %% fold %% **Five Basic Tastes**:
	- **Sweet, Sour, Salty, Bitter, Umami**: These are the five universally recognized tastes. Umami, often associated with savory flavors, was only recently acknowledged as a distinct taste.
	- Taste buds are primarily located on the **tongue** but are also found throughout the mouth and throat. These contain taste receptors, which are activated by the chemicals from food that dissolve in saliva. Signals from the taste buds are sent to the **thalamus** and then to the **insula** and **frontal cortex**, where the perception of taste occurs.

2. %% fold %% **Influence of smell and texture**:
	- Taste perception is influenced by the sense of **smell**. Foods seem bland when the sense of smell is impaired (e.g., during a cold).
	- **Texture** (soft, crunchy, creamy) also affects the overall sensory experience, as well as discomfort, such as the spiciness from chili peppers.

3. %% fold %% **Cultural Influences on Taste**:
	- Cultural factors, including prenatal exposure, can affect food preferences. For example, babies whose mothers consumed carrot juice during pregnancy showed a preference for carrot-flavored foods later.

4. %% fold %% **Supertasters**:
	- Some individuals, known as **supertasters**, have more taste buds than the average person and experience heightened taste sensations, particularly an aversion to bitter flavors.

## %% fold %% Smell (Olfaction)

1. %% fold %% **How Smell Works**:
	- **Odorants** (chemical particles in the air) are inhaled into the nasal cavity, where they contact the **olfactory epithelium**, which contains thousands of smell receptors. These receptors send signals directly to the **olfactory bulb**, bypassing the thalamus (unlike other senses).
	- Different combinations of receptors are activated by different odorants, creating the perception of distinct smells.

2. %% fold %% **Smell and Emotion**:
	- The **intensity** of smells is processed in brain areas linked to **emotion** and **memory**, which is why certain scents can trigger strong memories and emotional responses.

3. %% fold %% **Pheromones**:
	- **Pheromones** are chemicals released by animals (and possibly humans) that trigger behavioral responses in others, particularly related to social and sexual behavior .

## %% fold %% Touch 

1. %% fold %% **Touch perception**:
	- The **skin** contains receptors that respond to pressure, temperature, and vibration. These signals travel through spinal or cranial nerves to the **thalamus** and then to the **primary somatosensory cortex** in the **parietal lobe**, where touch is processed.

2. %% fold %% **Types of pain**:
	- **Fast fibers** convey sharp, immediate pain (e.g., when you cut your finger), while **slow fibers** convey dull, chronic pain (e.g., muscle soreness). Fast fibers are myelinated for quicker transmission .

3. %% fold %% **Gate control theory of pain**:
	- The **gate control theory** suggests that pain signals can be blocked by **other sensory input** (e.g., rubbing an injury can reduce the sensation of pain by activating other receptors that interfere with pain signals).
