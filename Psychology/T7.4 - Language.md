Language is a system of communication that involves using sounds and symbols according to grammatical rules.

### %% fold %% **Elements of Language**

**1. Phonemes**:

- **Phonemes** are the basic sounds of speech, making them the building blocks of language. Each language uses a subset of all possible phonemes.

**2. Morphemes**:

- **Morphemes** are the smallest units of meaning in a language. For example, the word "unhappy" contains two morphemes: "un-" (meaning "not") and "happy" (a word that conveys a feeling).

**3. Syntax**:

- **Syntax** refers to the rules that govern how words are combined to form sentences. Syntax determines sentence structure.

**4. Semantics**:

- **Semantics** deals with the meaning of words and sentences. While syntax involves structure, semantics is concerned with meaning.

### %% fold %% **Language Acquisition**

**1. Stages of Language Development**:

- **Babbling**: In the first few months, infants start to produce sounds known as babbling. This eventually progresses to recognizable speech sounds.
    
- **One-Word Stage**: Around 12 months, children begin to produce their first words, often using one word to communicate entire thoughts.
    
- **Two-Word Stage**: Around 18-24 months, children begin combining two words (e.g., “want cookie”), forming rudimentary sentences.
    

**2. Critical Period for Language**:

- Research suggests that there is a critical period during which language acquisition must occur. Children deprived of language exposure during this critical period may never fully develop language skills.

### %% fold %% **Theories of Language Development**

**1. Behaviorist Theory**:

- According to behaviorist theories, language is learned through imitation, reinforcement, and conditioning. Children learn to speak by mimicking adults and receiving positive reinforcement.

**2. Nativist Theory** (Chomsky):

- **Noam Chomsky** proposed that humans are born with an innate ability to learn language, called the **language acquisition device (LAD)**. According to this theory, exposure to language triggers this inborn mechanism.

**3. Interactionist Theory**:

- This theory combines elements of both behaviorist and nativist views, suggesting that language development is influenced by both biological predispositions and social interactions.

### %% fold %% **Aphasia**

**1. Broca’s Aphasia**:

- **Broca’s aphasia** (expressive aphasia) is a language disorder resulting in difficulty producing speech, though comprehension is typically intact.

**2. Wernicke’s Aphasia**:

- **Wernicke’s aphasia** (receptive aphasia) involves difficulty understanding language. People with this condition can produce fluent speech, but the sentences often lack meaning.
