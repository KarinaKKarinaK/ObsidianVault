## Consciousness and brain activity 

Consciousness is our subjective experience of the world, which emerges from brain activity. Various theories and experiments help explain how this subjective awareness is linked to brain mechanisms:

1. **Global workspace model**: This model proposes that consciousness arises as a result of brain circuits being activated. Specific brain regions are engaged depending on the stimulus and the task, indicating that the conscious mind perceives information from across the brain.

2. **Brain activity indicating consciousness**: Studies have shown that even comatose individuals can demonstrate brain activity that may suggest consciousness. For instance, brain imaging techniques can reveal responses in individuals who cannot communicate but can follow verbal instructions by mentally imagining scenarios (e.g., playing tennis). This shows that brain activity can be used as an indicator of awareness in otherwise unresponsive individuals.

## Spatial neglect 

Spatial neglect, also called hemispatial neglect, is a neurological condition where an individual fails to attend to stimuli on one side of their environment, usually following damage to the right parietal lobe. This results in a lack of awareness of objects or even their own body on the left side. Patients with spatial neglect can still see these objects; they are simply unaware of them unless their attention is actively directed.

## Readiness potential 

- **Readiness potential**: Before a conscious decision is made to act, brain activity linked to motor preparation—referred to as the readiness potential—begins. Studies show this activity begins approximately 0.5 seconds before a person is consciously aware of their decision to act. This suggests that unconscious brain processes start preparing for actions before we are consciously aware of them .

- **Awareness of decision**: Conscious awareness of a decision occurs approximately 0.2 seconds before the action is taken, meaning a delay exists between the brain's preparatory activity and conscious awareness.

## Dophamine 

- **Dopamine reuptake**: Dopamine is a critical neurotransmitter involved in reward, pleasure, and addiction. Many stimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamines, work by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine, allowing it to remain active longer in the synapse. This leads to prolonged and intensified effects, such as increased pleasure and reward .

- **Effect of drugs on dopamine**: Methamphetamine and other stimulants like cocaine increase dopamine levels by either blocking its reuptake or stimulating its release, leading to heightened pleasure, focus, and in some cases, addiction. 
- Over time, however, the excessive use of these drugs can damage brain structures related to memory, emotion, and motivation .
