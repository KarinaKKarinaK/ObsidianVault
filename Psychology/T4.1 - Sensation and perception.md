**Key Concepts:**

1. **Distal Stimulus → Proximal Stimulus → Transduction → Sensation → Perception**:

	- **Distal Stimulus**: The actual object or event in the world (e.g., a tree in the distance).
	- **Proximal Stimulus**: The pattern of stimuli (light waves, sound waves, etc.) received by the sensory organs.
	- **Transduction**: The process of converting proximal stimuli into neural signals by sensory receptors.
	- **Sensation**: The detection of external stimuli by the sensory organs.
	- **Perception**: The interpretation and conscious experience of the stimuli.

2. **Thresholds**:

	- **Absolute Threshold**: The minimum intensity of a stimulus required to detect it 50% of the time.
	- **Subliminal Threshold**: Stimuli below the absolute threshold that are not consciously detected.
	- **Difference Threshold (Just Noticeable Difference, JND)**: The minimum difference in stimulus intensity required to detect a change.

3. **Qualitative vs Quantitative Sensory Information**:

	- **Qualitative Information**: Differences in the quality of stimuli (e.g., red vs. green color).
	- **Quantitative Information**: Differences in the intensity of stimuli (e.g., a dim vs. bright light).
