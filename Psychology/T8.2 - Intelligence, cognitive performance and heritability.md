1. %% fold %% **Speed of Mental Processing**:
    
    - People with higher IQs tend to respond faster and more consistently in reaction-time tasks. 
	    - For example, tasks that require pressing a key in response to a stimulus have been shown to correlate with general intelligence (g). Faster responses, especially in tasks involving choices, have a stronger relationship with higher IQ.
    - **Inspection Time**: Refers to how quickly a person can process a stimulus and respond correctly. People with higher IQs generally need less time for such tasks, indicating faster cognitive processing.
2. %% fold %% **Working Memory Capacity**:
    
    - General intelligence is closely related to working memory, which is the ability to hold and process information actively. Dual-component tasks (e.g., n-back tasks that require remembering and updating information) show a strong correlation with IQ.
    - **Attention**: Focusing attention while ignoring distractions plays a crucial role in intelligence. Being able to stay on task despite interruptions correlates with higher general intelligence.
3. %% fold %% **Brain Structure and Function**:
    
    - **Brain Size**: Studies show a small but significant correlation between brain size and intelligence, particularly with respect to regions involved in reasoning, problem-solving, and attentional control, such as the frontal lobes.
    - **Neural Efficiency**: People with higher IQs tend to have more efficient neural processes, allowing their brains to work faster and more effectively during cognitive tasks.
4. %% fold %% **Savant Syndrome**:
    
    - **Savants** are individuals with extraordinary abilities in specific areas (e.g., music, art, mathematics), despite having cognitive deficits in other domains. Savant abilities, such as photographic memory or complex mathematical calculations, highlight that traditional IQ tests may not fully capture exceptional abilities.
    - For example, **Kim Peek**, who was the inspiration for the character in _Rain Man_, had remarkable memory capabilities but struggled with basic daily activities.

#### **The Roots of Intelligence: Genes and Environment**

#trytorecall 

1. %% fold %% **Genetic Factors**:
    
    - Twin studies show that intelligence has a significant genetic component. Identical twins raised apart show high correlations in IQ scores, indicating that genes play a major role in cognitive abilities.
    - Intelligence is polygenic, meaning that it is influenced by many different genes, each having a small effect. No single "intelligence gene" has been identified.
2. %% fold %% **Environmental Influences**:
    
    - **Prenatal and Postnatal Factors**: A child’s development is influenced by factors such as maternal nutrition, exposure to toxins, and early education.
    - **Socioeconomic Status (SES)**: Children from wealthier families tend to have higher IQs due to better access to education, nutrition, and cognitive stimulation. This emphasizes the importance of the environment in shaping intellectual development.
    - **Enriched Environments**: Studies have shown that individuals raised in enriched environments with greater cognitive stimulation (e.g., access to books, educational activities) develop better cognitive abilities. Environments with intellectual challenges enhance brain development and improve cognitive functioning.
3. %% fold %% **The Flynn Effect**:
    
    - IQ scores have been steadily rising across generations, a phenomenon known as the **Flynn Effect**. This rise is thought to be due to environmental improvements, such as better education, health care, and nutrition, rather than genetic changes.
    - The increasing complexity of modern life, which requires more advanced cognitive skills, may also contribute to rising IQ scores over time.

#### **Group Differences in Intelligence**

1. %% fold %% **Gender Differences**:
    - Research has explored gender differences in specific cognitive abilities. Men tend to perform better on spatial tasks, while women excel in verbal tasks. 
	    - However, overall IQ differences between men and women are minimal, and most observed differences are likely due to social and environmental factors.
2. %% fold %% **Racial and Ethnic Differences**:
    - Group differences in IQ scores between races have been observed, but they are largely attributed to environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status, education quality, and access to resources.
    - The **American Psychological Association (APA)** has stated that there is no clear genetic explanation for these group differences, and environmental factors play a much larger role.

#### **Application of Intelligence in Real Life**

1. %% fold %% **Education**:
    
    - Intelligence is a predictor of academic success, but it is not the only factor. Traits like **self-control** and **grit**(the ability to persist in the face of challenges) often predict success better than IQ. Self-discipline is particularly important for academic achievement.
2. %% fold %% **Job Performance**:
    
    - IQ is moderately correlated with job performance, especially in complex professions requiring decision-making and problem-solving skills. However, IQ only predicts about 25% of the variation in job performance. Other factors, such as emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills, are also important for success in the workplace.
3. %% fold %% **Health and Longevity**:
    
    - Intelligence is linked to better health outcomes and longer life expectancy. People with higher IQs are more likely to make healthier lifestyle choices, such as avoiding smoking and following medical advice, which may contribute to their longer lifespans.

#### **Environmental and Social Impacts on Intelligence**

1. %% fold %% **Socioeconomic Status (SES) and Education**:
    
    - High SES is associated with higher IQ scores, but the relationship is largely driven by differences in access to education and resources, not innate ability. Interventions like early childhood education can help reduce these disparities.
2. %% fold %% **Cultural Differences**:
    
    - Intelligence is influenced by cultural factors, with different societies emphasizing different cognitive skills. Standardized intelligence tests may not fully capture the intellectual abilities of individuals from non-Western cultures, highlighting the importance of cross-cultural research.
3. %% fold %% **The Flynn Effect**:
    
    - The Flynn Effect demonstrates that environmental improvements have led to an overall increase in IQ scores across generations. Understanding how education, nutrition, and societal changes contribute to rising cognitive abilities is important for discussing intelligence trends.
