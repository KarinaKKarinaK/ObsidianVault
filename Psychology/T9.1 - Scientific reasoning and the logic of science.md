#### **1. Introduction to Scientific Reasoning**

Scientific reasoning is about applying a structured, logical approach to understanding the world through the scientific method.

#### **2. The Logic Behind Science**

Scientific inquiry is built on a foundation of logical reasoning, combining **deductive** and **inductive reasoning**:

- **Deductive reasoning**: Moves from the general to the specific. It applies a general rule or theory to predict a specific outcome. An example of deduction is:
    
    - **Premise**: If it rains, I will stay at home.
    - **Observation**: It rains.
    - **Conclusion**: I stay at home.
- **Inductive reasoning**: Involves moving from specific observations to broader generalizations. It is less certain but is often used to form hypotheses. For example:
    
    - You observe that all swans you've seen are white, so you might conclude that **all swans are white**, though this might not always be true.

#### **3. The Scientific Method**

- **Theory**: A set of statements describing general principles about how variables relate to each other. It aims to explain phenomena and is based on evidence from the empirical world.
- **Hypothesis**: A specific, testable prediction derived from a theory. It is tested through empirical research.
- **Data**: Observations collected during research, which are used to support or refute the hypothesis.

The **scientific method** follows a cyclical pattern:

- **Theory** → **Hypothesis** → **Data collection** → **Interpretation** → **Theory revision** or **support**.

#### **4. Falsifiability Criterion**

For a hypothesis to be scientific, it must be falsifiable—meaning there must be some possible outcome that could show the hypothesis to be false. If no such outcome exists, then the hypothesis is not scientifically testable.

- Example: The hypothesis "time dilation exists" is scientifically testable through experiments, such as those involving atomic clocks on airplanes.
- In contrast, claims like "aliens visit Earth regularly" often lack the empirical methods needed for falsifiability and thus are not considered scientific.

#### **5. Types of Scientific Arguments**
#trytorecall 
- **Modus Ponens (Affirming the Antecedent)**:
    - If A, then B.
    - A is true, therefore B is true.
- **Modus Tollens (Denying the Consequent)**:
    - If A, then B.
    - B is not true, therefore A is not true.

These logical structures are foundational to how scientists justify or refute hypotheses.

#### **6. Falsification and Theory Revision**

The aim of scientific research is not to prove a theory definitively but to provide evidence in support of or against it. A hypothesis might be supported by evidence, but no single study can definitively prove a theory. Similarly, a theory might need revision if new data fail to support it.
