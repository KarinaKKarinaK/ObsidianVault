## Cognitive aspects of learning and Rescorla-wagner model of classical conditioning

Operant and classical conditioning have cognitive elements that help explain how learning takes place, particularly in terms of prediction and expectation.

### **Rescorla-Wagner Model of Classical Conditioning**​

The **Rescorla-Wagner model** emphasizes the importance of expectation in learning. According to this model, the strength of a conditioned response (CR) depends on how well the conditioned stimulus (CS) predicts the unconditioned stimulus (US).

1. %% fold %% **Prediction Error:**
    
    - **Positive Prediction Error:** Occurs when something unexpected happens after the CS (e.g., receiving a stronger US than expected). This strengthens the CS-US association.
    - **Negative Prediction Error:** Occurs when the expected US does not occur, weakening the CS-US association​(Psychological Science …).
    
    Example: If you use an electric can opener to feed your dog, the sound of the can opener (CS) predicts food (US). If you switch to a manual opener without the sound, the dog experiences a prediction error, and over time, it learns the manual opener predicts food​.
    
2. %% fold %% **Blocking:**
    
    - Once a CS is reliably associated with a US, no new stimuli paired with the CS will be associated with the US. This is known as **blocking**, where prior knowledge of a CS-US association prevents the formation of a new association​.

## Latent learning and cognitive maps (Tolman’s Cognitive Theory) + Learned helplessness

%% fold %% Latent learning refers to learning that occurs without reinforcement but is not demonstrated until reinforcement is available. 
	Edward Tolman showed that rats could form **cognitive maps** (mental representations) of mazes even without receiving rewards. When reinforcement was introduced, the rats were able to navigate the maze quickly because they had already learned its layout without reinforcement​.

**Learned helplessness** occurs when an organism, after experiencing uncontrollable and unavoidable negative events, learns to behave passively because it believes it cannot influence outcomes. This concept, discovered by Martin Seligman, helps explain depression and other psychological conditions where individuals feel powerless to change their circumstances​.

## Observational learning 

Observational learning is learning by watching others and imitating their behavior. This type of learning doesn’t require direct experience; rather, individuals can learn by observing the actions of others and the consequences that follow.

1. %% fold %% **Bandura's Social Learning Theory**:
    
    - Albert Bandura demonstrated the power of observational learning in his famous **Bobo Doll experiment**. 
	    - In this study, children who observed an adult acting aggressively toward a doll were more likely to imitate the aggressive behavior, especially if the adult was rewarded for their actions.
2. %% fold %% **Modeling**:
    
    - The process of observing and imitating a specific behavior is called **modeling**. This can occur without the learner directly interacting with the environment. 
	    - For example, a child might observe their parents' behavior and adopt similar behaviors without needing to be directly reinforced​.
3. %% fold %% **Vicarious Learning**:
    
    - Vicarious learning occurs when an individual learns by watching others be reinforced or punished for their behaviors. If someone sees another person being rewarded for a specific action, they are more likely to imitate that action​.
4. %% fold %% **Mirror Neurons**:
    
    - **Mirror neurons** in the brain are thought to play a key role in observational learning. These neurons activate both when an individual performs an action and when they observe someone else performing the same action, facilitating imitation and learning​.

### **Applications of Observational Learning**

1. %% fold %% **Media Violence**:
    
    - Observational learning is often used to explain the effects of media violence on behavior. 
	    - For example, children who watch violent television shows or video games may imitate the aggression they observe, especially if the violent characters are rewarded​.

2. %% fold %% **Cultural Transmission**:
    
    - Cultural norms and behaviors are often passed down through observational learning, where individuals learn societal expectations by watching others​.
