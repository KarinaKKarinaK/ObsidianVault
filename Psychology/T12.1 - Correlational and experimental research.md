Correlational research focuses on identifying whether there is a relationship between two measured variables. It helps in forming association claims, such as:

- "People who often watch violence on TV are more violent than others."
- "Mental disorders are more common among unemployed people than among those with a job."

However, correlation does **not** establish causation due to limitations like the **directionality problem** and the **third-variable problem**.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. %% fold %% **Bivariate Correlation:**
    
    - The association between exactly **two variables**. The association can be positive, negative, or zero.
	    - Example: A study on marital satisfaction found that people who met their spouse online reported slightly higher levels of satisfaction than those who met offline​.
2. %% fold %% **Correlation Coefficient (r):**
    
    - Ranges from **-1 to +1**. The closer it is to -1 or +1, the stronger the relationship.
    - **Positive correlation**: As one variable increases, so does the other.
    - **Negative correlation**: As one variable increases, the other decreases.
    - **Zero correlation**: No relationship between variables.
3. %% fold %% **Scatterplots:**
    
    - Graphs showing the relationship between two variables. For example, a scatterplot may show that more time spent sitting correlates with thinner brain regions​.
4. %% fold %% **Third-Variable Problem:**
    
    - A third variable might explain the observed correlation. 
	    - For example, high temperatures can be linked to both ice cream sales and drowning, but the two are not causally linked to each other.

### **Experimental Research and Causal Claims :**

Experimental research manipulates one variable (independent variable) and measures another (dependent variable) to establish causality. Unlike correlational research, experiments allow researchers to make **causal claims**, such as **"taking notes by hand causes better conceptual understanding."**

1. %% fold %% **Independent and Dependent Variables:**
    
    - The **independent variable** is manipulated, and its effect on the **dependent variable** is measured.
	    - Example: Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) manipulated note-taking (laptop vs. longhand) and found that students taking longhand notes performed better on conceptual questions.
2. %% fold %% **Control Variables:**
    
    - These are variables that are kept constant to avoid confounding the results. 
	    - For example, all students watched the same TED talks during the note-taking experiment​.
3. %% fold %% **Criteria for Causality:**
    
    - **Covariance**: The two variables must be related.
    - **Temporal Precedence**: The cause must come before the effect.
    - **Internal Validity**: There must be no alternative explanation for the relationship​.


##### %% fold %% **Spurious Correlation:**

A **spurious correlation** occurs when two variables appear to be related, but in reality, they are both influenced by a third variable (or variables), or the relationship is due to random chance. In other words, the correlation between the two variables does not reflect a direct causal link between them.

- **Example:** There might be a positive correlation between the number of ice creams sold and the number of drowning incidents in a given period. This does not mean that ice cream consumption causes drowning. Instead, both are linked to a **third variable**, such as hot weather. When it's hotter, people are more likely to buy ice cream and also more likely to go swimming, which increases the risk of drowning​.
    
- **Third-Variable Problem:** This issue arises when an unmeasured third variable affects both variables of interest, creating a spurious correlation. For example, a researcher may find a correlation between watching violent TV shows and aggression in children, but a third variable, such as parenting style, could explain both the increased TV viewing and aggressive behavior​.
    

##### %% fold %% **Curvilinear Association:**

A **curvilinear association** refers to a relationship between two variables that is **not linear**; instead, the relationship changes direction at some point. In a curvilinear relationship, the correlation between variables might be positive up to a certain point and then become negative, or vice versa.

- **Example:** The relationship between age and health might be curvilinear. Up to a certain age, people become healthier as they age (due to increasing physical strength, for example), but after a certain point, health tends to decline with age.
    
- **Scatterplots and Curvilinear Associations:** Unlike linear relationships, which can be captured by a straight line on a scatterplot, curvilinear relationships show a curved pattern. This is why relying solely on linear correlation coefficients (such as **Pearson’s r**) may miss these types of relationships, as **r** only measures linear associations​.
    
- **Detection of Curvilinear Relationships:** Researchers use different techniques, such as plotting the data or running **quadratic regressions**, to detect and analyze curvilinear relationships. A linear analysis may mistakenly show a zero or weak correlation when the actual relationship is curvilinear.
