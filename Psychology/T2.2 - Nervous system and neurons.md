## The nervous system 

The nervous system is the body's communication network that influences everything we think, feel, and do. It is composed of two primary systems:

**A. Central nervous system (CNS)**

- **Components**: The **brain** and **spinal cord**.
- **Functions**: The CNS processes, interprets, and stores information; it also sends orders to muscles, glands, and organs. It acts as the body's main control center.

**B. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**

- %% fold %% **Components**: All other nerve cells in the body outside the CNS. It includes the **somatic** and **autonomic** nervous systems:

	- **Somatic nervous system**: Controls **voluntary movements** and transmits sensory information to the CNS.
	
	- **Autonomic nervous system**: Regulates **involuntary** bodily functions (like heart rate, digestion). It is further divided into:
	
		- **Sympathetic nervous system**: Prepares the body for action (fight or flight response).
		
		- **Parasympathetic nervous system**: Calms the body and conserves energy (rest and digest).

## Neurons 

#trytorecall 

- Neurons are the **basic units** of the nervous system responsible for receiving, integrating, and transmitting information. They operate through **electrical impulses** and **chemical signals** to communicate with other neurons.

- Neurons communicate in **circuits** or **neural networks**, developed through genetics, experience, and repeated firing.

**A. Types of Neurons**

1. **Sensory neurons (Afferent neurons)**: Detect information from the physical world and send this information to the brain.
2. **Motor Neurons (Efferent Neurons)**: Direct muscles to contract or relax, thus controlling movement.
3. **Interneurons**: Facilitate communication between sensory and motor neurons, forming a vast network within the CNS.

**B. Structure of a Neuron**

- **Dendrites**: Branch-like extensions that **receive signals** from neighboring neurons.

- **Cell Body (Soma)**: Collects and integrates information received by the dendrites.

- **Axon**: A long, narrow outgrowth that **transmits electrical impulses** from the cell body to the terminal buttons.

- **Terminal Buttons**: Endings of the axon that release chemical signals (neurotransmitters) into the synapse to communicate with other neurons.

- **Myelin Sheath**: A layer of fatty cells encasing the axon, increasing the **speed of neural transmission**. This insulation is vital for fast communication across neurons.

## Neural communication 

Neurons communicate via **electrical** and **chemical processes**.

**A. Action Potential**

- Is a brief electrical impulse that travels down the axon. Neurons are powered by **electrical impulses**, and this electrical charge allows communication between neurons.

- %% fold %% **All-or-None Law**: Neurons either **fire or don’t fire**. When they do fire, the action potential is always the same strength. The variation comes in the:
	- **rate of firing** 
	- **number of neurons** firing

**B. Synapses and Neurotransmitters**

- **Synapse**: The tiny gap between the terminal buttons of one neuron and the dendrites of another. Neurons do not touch; instead, they communicate by releasing **neurotransmitters** into the synapse.

- **Neurotransmitters**: Chemicals that transmit signals across the synapse to the next neuron. These signals are essential for brain communication and affect everything from mood to movement.

- **Neurotransmitter binding**: When neurotransmitters are released into the synapse, they bind to specific receptors on the receiving neuron, which can generate either an **excitatory** or **inhibitory** signal. Excitatory signals increase the likelihood of the neuron firing, while inhibitory signals decrease it.


**C. Termination of Neurotransmitter Activity**

The signal from neurotransmitters is terminated by three main processes:

1. **Autoreceptors**: Detect the amount of neurotransmitter released and signal the presynaptic neuron to stop the release.
2. **Synaptic reuptake**: The neurotransmitter is reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron.
3. **Enzyme deactivation**: Enzymes break down the neurotransmitters in the synapse.

**D. Drugs and Neurotransmitters**

- **Agonists**: Enhance neurotransmitter action by increasing production or preventing reuptake (e.g., SSRIs, which increase serotonin).

- **Antagonists**: Inhibit neurotransmitter action by blocking receptors or enhancing the breakdown of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine antagonists for schizophrenia).
