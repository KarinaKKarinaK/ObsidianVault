## Sleep and attention in relation to consciousness 

Consciousness fluctuates naturally between wakefulness, sleep, and altered states caused by attention and external factors like drugs.

1. **Sleep Stages and Consciousness**:
	- **NREM Sleep**: Includes stages 1–3 where brain activity slows down. In stage 1, one may experience fleeting images, and by stage 3, there is minimal awareness.
	
	- **REM Sleep**: Characterized by vivid, bizarre dreams. Despite being in an altered state of consciousness, the body is paralyzed except for eye movements .

- %% fold %% **Theories of Sleep**:
	- **Restorative theory**: Suggests that sleep restores the body, including the brain, after daily wear and tear.
	
	- **Circadian rhythm theory**: Aligns sleep patterns with light/dark cycles for safety.
	
	- **Facilitation of learning theory**: Indicates that sleep strengthens neural connections, aiding in memory and learning.

**Attention as a gateway to consciousness**:

- **Attention and dichotic listening**: Attention enables selective focus on specific stimuli while ignoring others. However, significant information like one’s name can break through the unattended stimuli (e.g., cocktail party phenomenon). This underscores the limits of consciousness, which is shaped by attention .

- %% fold %% **Endogenous vs. Exogenous Attention**:
	- **Endogenous attention** is driven by internal goals, like focusing on a textbook.
	- **Exogenous attention** is captured by external stimuli, like loud noises .

## Free will, brain injuries and consciousness 

The concept of free will is questioned by findings on **readiness potential**:

- **Readiness potential** refers to brain activity that starts about **0.5 seconds before a conscious decision** to act is made. This suggests that unconscious processes guide behavior even before one becomes consciously aware of their choice .

**Brain injury and consciousness**

1. %% fold %% **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**: A significant factor affecting consciousness. TBIs range from mild concussions, which may temporarily impair consciousness, to severe injuries that can result in long-lasting or permanent damage.

	- **Concussions**: Even mild TBIs, like concussions, can have long-term effects, especially with repeated injuries. They are of particular concern for athletes due to the risk of cumulative damage .
	
	- **Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome**: Describes a condition where individuals appear awake but do not show conscious awareness due to severe brain damage .
	
	- **Minimally conscious state vs. brain death**: While some people in a minimally conscious state may show limited awareness, those in a state of brain death exhibit no brain activity.

## Drugs and their effect on consciousness 

1. **Psychoactive Drugs**: These substances change neurochemistry by affecting neurotransmitter systems, altering consciousness, mood, and behavior.

	- ==**Stimulants**: Drugs like cocaine and amphetamines **increase dopamine** activity, heightening alertness, pleasure, and restlessness. Dopamine reuptake is blocked, keeping it in the synapse longer, enhancing its effects.
	
	- ==**Depressants**: Drugs such as alcohol reduce brain activity by **enhancing the effect of GABA**, leading to slower reactions and a relaxed state .
	
	- ==**Opioids**: Drugs like heroin act on the brain’s **endorphin** system, providing pain relief and intense pleasure.
	
	- ==**Hallucinogens**: These include substances like LSD, which alter perception, mood, and cognition by interacting with **serotonin** receptors .==
