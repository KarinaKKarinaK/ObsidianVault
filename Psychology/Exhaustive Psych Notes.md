## **Introduction to Psychology and its Methods AI: Comprehensive Exam Notes**

### **Part I: Genetic and Biological Basis of Behaviour (Topics 1–8)**

### **Topic 1: Genes and Evolution**

#### **1. Core Concepts and Definitions**

- **Psychological Science:** The **scientific study of mind, brain, and behaviour**.
- **Mind/Body Problem:** Modern [[Psychology]] rejects **dualism** (mind and body are separate) and agrees that the mind arises from **brain activity**.
- **Nature vs. Nurture:** Both genetics (nature) and environment (nurture) **continuously interact** to shape behaviour.
- **Genome:** The entire set of genes in an organism, acting as the blueprint.
- **Genotype:** The **genetic makeup** of an individual, determined at conception and constant throughout life.
	- *A **genome** is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes and other non-coding regions. In contrast, **genotype** is the term used for the specific set of alleles (variant forms of a gene) an organism carries, either for a single trait or for all its genes, and is often used more narrowly than genome*
- **Phenotype:** The **observable traits and behaviours** resulting from the interaction between genotype and environment.
    - _Example:_ Height is determined by genetics (genotype) but influenced by nutrition (environment).
- **Polygenic Traits:** Most human traits (e.g., intelligence) are influenced by **multiple genes and environmental factors**.
- **Allele:** One specific variant of a gene.
    - **Homozygote:** Alleles on the locus are the same.
    - **Heterozygote:** Alleles on the locus are different.
    - For a property to be recessively inherited, it **must be passed by both parents to express itself in the phenotype**.

#### **2. Gene Expression and Environment (Most Important)**

- **Gene Expression:** Genes must be **activated** (expressed) for their effects to be visible. This is regulated by biochemical and environmental influences (e.g., stress, nutrition, social experiences).
	- The **biochemical environment inside the cell** controls gene expression.This environment is influenced by the overall environment, timing in development, experience, and behaviour.
- **Methylation:** A biochemical process that can modify gene activity (often suppressing it) without changing the DNA structure.
- **Epigenetics:** The study of how **environmental factors** (like stress or diet) influence gene expression, turning genes on or off, without altering the genetic code itself.

#### **3. Behavioural Genetics and Heritability**

- **Behavioural Genetics:** Studies the interaction between genetics and environment to explain behaviour.
- **Heritability Estimate:** A statistical measure (ranging from 0 to 1, or 0% to 100%, so 0.9 would be very likely due to genetics) of how much of the **variation in a trait within a population** is due to genetics.
    - _**Important:**_ Heritability applies to **populations**, not individuals.
- **Research Methods (Approach):**
    - **Twin Studies:** Compares monozygotic (100% genes shared) and dizygotic (50% genes shared) twins. If identical twins are more similar, it suggests a strong genetic influence.
    - **Adoption Studies:** Compares adopted children to both biological and adoptive parents to separate genetic and environmental influences.

#### **4. Evolution and Natural Selection**

- **Variation among individuals** of a population is an **essential condition for evolutionary change**
- **Natural Selection (Darwin):** The core mechanism of evolution. Traits that improve survival and reproduction are passed on.
- **Three Conditions for Natural Selection:** 1. **Variation** in traits, 2. **Differential survival and reproduction**, 3. **Heritability** of advantageous traits.
- **Evolutionary [[Psychology]]:** Focuses on how natural selection shapes psychological traits (e.g., forming social bonds for survival).

### **Topic 2: Brain and Development**

#### **1. The Nervous System**

- **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Composed of the **brain** and **spinal cord**; processes and stores information.
- The nervous system consists of **Glia** and **Neurons**.
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** All other nerve cells outside the CNS.
    - **Somatic Nervous System:** Controls **voluntary movements** and transmits sensory input.
    - **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):** Regulates **involuntary functions**.
        - **Sympathetic:** **Fight or flight** response (prepares body for action).
        - **Parasympathetic:** **Rest and digest** (calms body, conserves energy).

#### **2. Neurons and Communication (Most Important)**

- **Neurons:** The **basic units** of the nervous system, transmitting information via electrical and chemical signals.
    - **Sensory (Afferent) Neurons:** Send information **towards the brain**.
    - **Motor (Efferent) Neurons:** Send directions **towards the muscles**.
    - **Interneurons:** Communicate between sensory and motor neurons within the CNS.
- **Neural Structure:** **Dendrites** (receive signals), **Cell Body** (integrates info), **Axon** (transmits impulse), **Myelin Sheath** (increases speed), **Terminal Buttons** (release NTs).
![[Pasted image 20251014150259.png]]
- **Action Potential:** The electrical impulse traveling down the axon. Governed by the **All-or-None Law** (it either fires or it doesn't; strength is constant).
- **Synapse:** The gap between neurons where communication occurs via **neurotransmitters (NTs)**.
    - NTs generate either an **excitatory** (increases firing likelihood) or **inhibitory** (decreases firing likelihood) signal.
- **NT Termination (The process of stopping the signal):** 1. **Autoreceptors** (signal stop of release), 2. **Synaptic Reuptake** (reabsorption by presynaptic neuron), 3. **Enzyme Deactivation** (breakdown in the synapse).

#### **3. Key Neurotransmitters and Drug Effects**

| Neurotransmitter        | Function                                                                | Imbalances/Associated Drug Action                                                                                      |

| **GABA**                | Primary **Inhibitory** NT                                               | Low activity linked to **Anxiety** (Benzodiazepines enhance GABA).                                                     |
| **Glutamate**           | Primary **Excitatory** NT, Learning, Memory                             | Excessive release causes excitotoxicity (e.g., stroke).                                                                |
| **Acetylcholine (ACh)** | Motor control, Memory, Learning                                         | Low levels linked to **Alzheimer’s disease**.                                                                          |
##### Drugs:
 - **Agonists enhance NT action** (e.g., increasing precursor, blocking reuptake, or **mimicking the neurotransmitter’s action**).
- **Antagonists inhibit NT action** (e.g., blocking receptors).
#### **4. Brain Structure and Function**

- **Cerebral Cortex:** Outer layer, responsible for higher functions (thought, perception).

- **Synaptic Pruning:** Elimination of unused synaptic connections to increase efficiency.
- **Critical Periods:** Specific times (often in childhood) when the brain is highly sensitive to environmental stimuli (e.g., language acquisition).
- **Hemispheric Specialization (Lateralization):** Left and Right hemispheres have specialized functions, connected by the **Corpus Callosum**.
    - **Left H.:** Language, logic, analytical tasks.
    - **Right H.:** Spatial abilities, facial recognition, emotion processing.
- **Split-Brain Studies:** Cutting the corpus callosum reveals the independence of the hemispheres. _Finding: If an image is presented to the left visual field (processed by the right hemisphere), the patient cannot verbalize it (left hemisphere is needed for speech) but can select the object with their left hand_.

#### **6. Methods of Studying the Brain (Approach)**

- **Clinical Observations:** Inferring function from patients with injuries (e.g., Phineas Gage established frontal lobe role in personality/control; Broca's area).
- **Experimental Techniques:**
    - **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** Measures **electrical activity**. Good **temporal resolution (when)**, poor spatial resolution (where).
    - **fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** Measures blood oxygen levels to map brain activity. Good **spatial resolution (where)**.
    - **TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation):** Temporarily influences brain activity to study the function of specific regions.

### **Topic 3: Consciousness**

#### **1. Defining and Measuring Consciousness**

- **Consciousness:** Our **subjective experience** of the world, stemming from brain activity.
- **Global Workspace Model:** Consciousness arises from active brain circuits integrating information across the brain.
- **Hard Problem of Consciousness (Crucial Theory):** Explaining how subjective experiences (**qualia**) arise from physical brain processes.
- **Readiness Potential (Crucial Finding):** Brain activity relating to motor preparation begins approximately **0.5 seconds before a person is consciously aware** of their decision to act, suggesting unconscious processes initiate actions.

#### **2. Variations in Consciousness**

- **Attention:** Acts as a gateway to consciousness & The process that enables selective focus.
    - **Endogenous Attention:** **Goal-driven**, voluntary, sustained focus (e.g., studying a textbook).
    - **Exogenous Attention:** **Stimulus-driven**, involuntary, transient focus (e.g., a loud noise).

	- **Cocktail Party Phenomenon:** The ability to selectively attend to one voice among many, though unattended information may sometimes break through.
    - **Shadowing (Dichotic Listening):** A technique where a participant repeats back **words heard in one ear**.
    - **Change Blindness:** Failing to notice changes without much awareness.
- **Sleep:** A naturally altered state of consciousness.
    - **REM Sleep:** Characterized by **vivid dreams** and body paralysis.
	    - **Dreams:** Products of an altered state; REM dreams are bizarre and intense, while Non-REM dreams are dull.
    - **Sleep Theories:** **Restorative** (restores body/brain), **Circadian rhythm** (safety/light cycles), **Facilitation of learning** (strengthens memory).
- **Automatic vs. Controlled Processing:**
    - **Automatic Processing:** Tasks that require little conscious effort (e.g., driving proficiently).
    - **Controlled Processing:** Requires focused attention (e.g., learning a new task).
    - **Stroop Effect:** Demonstrates conflict between automatic reading and controlled naming of ink color.
- **Subliminal Perception:** Stimuli processed by sensory systems without reaching consciousness. Can have modest effects, especially on motivation.

### **Topic 4: Sensation and Perception**

##### **Sensation vs. Perception**

- **Sensation:** The **detection of external stimuli** and the transmission of this information to the brain.
- **Perception:** The **processing, organization, and interpretation** of sensory signals.
- **The Pathway:** Distal Stimulus → Proximal Stimulus → Transduction → Sensation → Perception.

#### **1. The Sensory Pathway**

- **Process:** **Distal Stimulus** (real object) → **Proximal Stimulus** (sensory input) → **Transduction** (conversion to neural signal) → **Sensation** (detection) → **Perception** (interpretation and conscious experience).
- **Thresholds:**
    - **Absolute Threshold:** Minimum intensity needed to detect a stimulus **50% of the time**.
    - **Difference Threshold (Just Noticeable Difference, JND):** Minimum difference required to detect a change in intensity.

#### **2. Vision (Sensation)**

- **Retina:** Contains sensory receptors (photoreceptors) for transduction.
    - **Rods:** Responsible for low light/night vision and black/white perception.
    - **Cones:** Responsible for **colour perception** and fine detail.
- **Light Properties:** **Wavelength** determines colour (qualitative); **Intensity** determines brightness (quantitative).
- **Colour Vision Theories (Most Important):**
    - **Trichromatic Theory:** Based on three types of cones sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), and long (red) wavelengths.
    - **Opponent-Process Theory:** Perception is controlled by opposing pairs (red-green, blue-yellow, black-white). Explains **afterimages**.
![[Pasted image 20251014192036.png]]
![[Pasted image 20251014192142.png]]
#### **3. Perception (Interpretation)**

- **Processing Models:**
    - **Bottom-Up Processing:** Data-driven; perception begins with sensory input and builds up to interpretation.
    - **Top-Down Processing:** Knowledge-driven; perception is influenced by prior **expectations and knowledge**.
- **Perceptual Organization (Gestalt Principles):**
    - **Proximity:** Grouping stimuli that are physically close together [66, 324 (Q19)].
    - **Similarity** *(The tendency to group items that **resemble each other** (e.g., in colour, shape, size, or orientation)*
    - **Continuity** *(the tendency to perceive lines or shapes as following the **smoothest path**, even when they are interrupted or overlapped by other shapes)*, and 
	    - **Closure** *(The tendency to perceive shapes and figures as **complete** even if there are gaps or missing information. The brain "fills in" the missing contours to perceive a whole form)* are also key principles.
- **Perceptual Constancies:** Maintaining stable perception despite changing sensory input. Includes **Size, Shape, and Color Constancy**.
- **Visual Streams (Two-Stream Hypothesis):**
    - **Dorsal Stream (Where Pathway):** Processes spatial information and location; important for motor planning/interaction (The "How").
    - **Ventral Stream (What Pathway):** Processes object recognition (shape, color).
- **Depth Perception:** Uses cues to see in three dimensions.
    - **Binocular Cues:** Use input from both eyes (**Disparity, Convergence**).
    - **Monocular Cues:** Use input from one eye (e.g., **Occlusion, Linear Perspective, Relative Size**).

#### **4. Non-Visual Senses**

- **Audition (Hearing):** **Frequency** determines pitch; **Amplitude** determines loudness. Pitch perception uses **Temporal Coding** (low frequencies) and **Place Coding** (high frequencies).
- **Vestibular Sense:** Sense of **balance and spatial orientation**, relying on the semicircular canals in the inner ear.
- **Touch:** Processed in the **somatosensory cortex** (Parietal Lobe).
    - **Gate Control Theory of Pain:** Pain signals can be blocked or inhibited by other sensory input (e.g., rubbing an injury).
- **Smell (Olfaction):** **Bypasses the thalamus** and sends signals directly to the olfactory bulb. Linked strongly to emotion and memory.

### **Topic 5: Learning**

#### **1. Types of Learning (Crucial Categories)**

- **Non-Associative Learning:** Change in response after repeated exposure to a single stimulus.
    - **Habituation:** **Decrease** in response (e.g., stopping noticing a constant noise).
    - **Sensitization:** **Increase** in response (often to threatening stimuli).
- **Associative Learning:** Learning the relationship between two stimuli or events.
- **Observational Learning:** Learning by watching others (social learning).

#### **2. Classical Conditioning (Pavlovian)**

- A neutral stimulus becomes associated with a response after being paired with a stimulus that naturally produces that response.
- **Key Components:**
    - **Unconditioned Stimulus (US):** Naturally triggers a response (e.g., food).
    - **Unconditioned Response (UR):** Natural, unlearned reaction (e.g., salivation to food).
    - **Conditioned Stimulus (CS):** Previously neutral, now elicits a response (e.g., metronome sound).
    - **Conditioned Response (CR):** Learned response to the CS (e.g., salivation to the sound).
- **Rescorla-Wagner Model (Cognitive Approach):** Emphasizes **prediction**. The strength of the CR depends on how well the CS **predicts** the US.
    - **Blocking:** Prior learning of one CS-US association prevents the learning of a new one.
- **Classical conditioning** requires **Contiguity** (CS presented before US) and **Contingency** (CS should be informative about the US occurrence).
- **Extinction:** Eliminating the CR by repeatedly presenting the CS alone.
- **Spontaneous Recovery:** CR returns after extinction and a rest interval.
- **Stimulus Generalization:** CR elicited by stimuli similar to the CS.
- **Cognitivist View:** The CS functions as a predictor of the US, and the CR is a reaction in preparation for the US.

#### **3. Operant Conditioning (Instrumental Conditioning - Most Important)**

- Learning based on the **consequences** of voluntary actions = Learning based on the **consequence of an action/response** determining the likelihood it will be performed again. Learned is the relationship between **response and reward/punishment** 
- **Law of Effect (Thorndike):** Behaviors followed by satisfying outcomes are more likely to be repeated.
- **Reinforcement (Increases Behaviour):**
    - **Positive Reinforcement:** **Adding** a desirable stimulus (e.g., giving a treat).
    - **Negative Reinforcement:** **Removing** an unpleasant stimulus (e.g., stopping a shock).
- **Punishment (Decreases Behaviour):**
    - **Positive Punishment:** **Adding** an unpleasant stimulus (e.g., speeding ticket).
    - **Negative Punishment:** **Removing** a desirable stimulus (e.g., taking away a phone).
- **Shaping:** Reinforcing **successive approximations** of a complex behaviour.
- **Superstitious Behaviour:** Occurs when a behaviour is accidentally reinforced (Skinner’s pigeons).

##### How To Distinguish Between Operant and Classical Conditioning
===Classical conditioning associates two stimuli to elicit an involuntary response, while operant conditioning links a voluntary behavior to its consequence, which either increases or decreases the likelihood of the behavior repeating==. In classical conditioning, the stimulus comes before the behavior (e.g., a bell paired with food). In operant conditioning, the consequence comes after the behavior (e.g., getting a treat for an action).
#### **4. Schedules of Reinforcement (Crucial for Resistance to Extinction)**

- **Continuous Reinforcement:** Every instance is rewarded (fast learning, fast extinction).
- **Partial (Intermittent) Reinforcement:** Rewards are intermittent; leads to behaviours **more resistant to extinction**.
    - **Fixed Ratio (FR):** Reward after set number of responses.
    - **Variable Ratio (VR):** Reward after varying number of responses (highest response rate, e.g., slot machines).
    - **Fixed Interval (FI):** Reward after set time period.
    - **Variable Interval (VI):** Reward after varying time period.
- Continuous reinforcement = fastest extinction

#### **5. Cognitive and Social Learning**

- **Latent Learning:** Learning that occurs **without reinforcement** and is only demonstrated once reinforcement becomes available.
	- *This type of "hidden" learning occurs without any immediate reinforcement or reward, such as when a child learns a route to school by observation, but only uses that knowledge when they need to bike there themselves.*
- **Cognitive Maps (Tolman):** Mental representations of spatial layouts, formed via latent learning.
- **Learned Helplessness:** Passive behaviour learned after experiencing uncontrollable negative events, leading to the belief that outcomes cannot be influenced.
- **Observational Learning (Bandura):** Learning by watching others (modeling).
	- **Observational learning (Social learning):** Acquisition or modification of behaviour after exposure to another individual performing that behaviour.
	- **Modeling:** Performing the observed behaviour.
	- **Vicarious learning:** Learning by watching others receive reinforcement or punishment.
	- **Mirror Neurons:** Neural mechanisms implicated in observational learning.

### **Topic 6: Memory**

#### **1. Memory Systems and Models**

- Memory is the nervous system’s capacity to retain and retrieve skills and knowledge.
- **Three Phases of Memory:**
    1. **Encoding:** Transforming stimuli into a storable format.
    2. **Storage and Consolidation:** Retention in memory traces.
    3. **Retrieval:** Accessing stored information (recall or recognition).

- **Atkinson-Shiffrin Model:** Divides memory into Sensory, Short-Term (Working), and Long-Term systems.
- **Sensory Memory:** Fleeting storage.
    - **Iconic memory:** Momentary visual memory (few tenths of a second).
    - **Echoic memory:** Momentary auditory memory (3–4 seconds).
- **Short-Term Memory (STM) / Working Memory:** Holds limited information (about 7 items) for 20-30 seconds. **Chunking** improves capacity.
- **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** Unlimited capacity, long duration.
    - **Explicit (Declarative):** Conscious recall. **Episodic** (events) and **Semantic** (facts/knowledge).
	    - **Episodic Memory:** This component stores memories of **specific personal experiences and events**, along with the context in which they occurred (e.g., what you ate for breakfast or details of a specific birthday party).
	    - **Semantic Memory:** This component stores **facts, general knowledge**, and concepts independent of personal experience (e.g., knowing the capital of France or what a bicycle is).
    - **Implicit (Nondeclarative):** Unconscious recall. **Procedural** (skills, e.g., riding a bike) and **Priming**.
	    - **Procedural Memory:** This covers **motor skills and habits** (e.g., knowing how to ride a bike, tie a shoelace, or play an instrument). This form of memory can be retained even if the ability to form new explicit memories is lost, as famously demonstrated by patient H.M., who, despite having **anterograde amnesia**, could still learn new motor tasks.
	    - **Priming:** This is a type of unconscious influence where exposure to one stimulus affects the response to a subsequent stimulus. For instance, exposure to the word "chair" makes it easier to recognize a related word like "table" later on. Priming is a demonstration of how prior exposure can influence behaviour without reaching conscious awareness.

#### **2. Encoding and Processing (Most Important)**

- **Encoding:** Transforming sensory input into a storable format.
- **Levels of Processing Theory:** Retention depends on the **depth of processing**.
    - **Shallow Processing:** Visual or acoustic encoding (poor recall).
    - **Deep Processing:** **Semantic Encoding** (based on meaning); leads to better retention.
- **Rehearsal Types:**
    - **Maintenance Rehearsal:** Simple repetition (poor LTM retention).
    - **Elaborative Rehearsal:** Linking new information to prior knowledge (deep encoding, good LTM retention).
- **Consolidation:** The process of stabilizing fragile short-term memories into permanent long-term memories. **Sleep** is crucial for consolidation.
- **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP):** Synaptic strengthening that supports memory consolidation.

#### **3. Retrieval**

- **Retrieval Cues:** Stimuli that help access stored memories.
    - **Context-Dependent Memory:** Recall is improved when the **environment/context** matches encoding.
    - **State-Dependent Memory:** Recall is improved when the **mental/emotional state** matches encoding.
- **Serial Position Effect:** Better recall for items at the **beginning (primacy effect)** and **end (recency effect)** of a list.
-  **Interference:** A cause of forgetting.
    - **Retroactive Interference:** When information learned later (new) decreases the probability of remembering previously learned information (old).
    - **Proactive Interference:** Old information hinders new information.

#### **4. Memory Failures and Distortions**

- **Forgetting:**
    - **Interference:** Similar information competes. **Proactive** (old hinders new) vs. **Retroactive** (new hinders old).
    - **Absentmindedness:** Forgetting due to lapses in attention during encoding.
    - **Blocking (Tip-of-the-Tongue):** Temporary inability to retrieve stored information.
    - **Encoding Failure** and **Storage Decay** (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve).
- **Memory Errors (Reconstructive Memory):**
    - **Suggestibility/Misinformation Effect (Loftus):** Memories are distorted by misleading post-event information or leading questions.
    - **Source Misattribution:** Remembering information but attributing it to the wrong source (e.g., **Cryptomnesia**—mistaking someone else's idea for your own).
    - **False Memories:** Recollections of events that never happened.
- **Amnesia:** Long-term memory deficit due to brain injury.
    - **Retrograde:** Loss of memories **before** the injury.
    - **Anterograde:** Inability to form **new** long-term memories (e.g., patient H.M.).

### **Topic 7: Thinking and Language**

#### **1. Mental Representations and Categorisation**

- **Analogical Representations:** Share characteristics with the physical object. Unlike perceptual images, mental images **cannot easily be reinterpreted** [328, 329 (Q28)].
- **Symbolic Representations:** Abstract representations (e.g., words).
- **Categorization:**
    - **Prototype Theory (Rosch):** Category membership depends on similarity to an "average" representation (prototype).
    - **Exemplar Theory (Nosofsky):** Category membership depends on similarity to specific, real examples (exemplars).

#### **2. Decision Making and Heuristics (Most Important)**

- **Normative Theories:** Describe how people **should** make rational decisions (e.g., **Expected Utility Theory**—maximizing expected outcome).
- **Descriptive Theories:** Describe how people **actually** make decisions (using biases and heuristics).
- **Heuristics (Mental Shortcuts):** Quick rules leading to fast, but often error-prone, judgments.
    - **Anchoring:** Over-reliance on the **first piece of information** (the anchor) when making judgments.
    - **Framing:** Decisions are affected by **how information is presented** (e.g., gains vs. losses, linked to loss aversion).
    - **Availability Heuristic:** Judging the likelihood of an event based on **how easily it comes to mind** (e.g., overestimating plane crash risk due to media coverage).
    - **Representativeness Heuristic:** Judging likelihood based on how well it **matches a prototype/stereotype**, ignoring base rate information.
    - **Affective Forecasting Heuristic:** Overestimating how events will make them feel in the future.
- **Satisficers vs. Maximizers:** A good strategy is to satisfice (find a 'good enough' option) rather than optimize (find the best option).

#### **3. Problem Solving (Approach)**

- **Obstacles to Solving Questions (Crucial):**
    - **Mental Set:** Sticking to strategies that worked previously, even if inappropriate now.
    - **Functional Fixedness:** Viewing objects only in terms of their typical function (e.g., Duncker’s Candle Problem).
- **Strategies:**
    - Breaking problems into **Subgoals**.
    - **Restructuring** the mental representation of the problem.
    - Using **Analogies** (applying a solution from a similar problem).
	    -  To solve a difficult problem, one needs to **encourage the person to use analogies**
    - **Algorithms** (step-by-step procedure guaranteeing a correct solution).

#### **4. Language**

- **Elements:** 
	- **Phonemes** (basic sounds)
	- **Morphemes** (smallest unit of meaning)
	- **Syntax** (grammar/rules of structure)
	- **Semantics** (meaning)
- **Theories of Development:**
    - **Nativist Theory (Chomsky):** Humans have an innate ability to learn language (Language Acquisition Device, LAD).
- **Brain Areas:**
    - **Broca’s Area (Frontal Lobe):** Critical for **speech production** (damage causes expressive aphasia).
    - **Wernicke’s Area (Temporal Lobe):** Essential for **language comprehension** (damage causes receptive aphasia).

### **Topic 8: Intelligence**

#### **1. Theories of Intelligence (Most Important)**

- **General Intelligence (g, Spearman):** A single underlying factor that influences performance across all intellectual tasks.
- **Fluid vs. Crystallized Intelligence (Cattell):**
    - **Fluid Intelligence:** Ability to reason and solve **new problems** without prior knowledge (e.g., puzzles, abstract thinking).
    - **Crystallized Intelligence:** Knowledge derived from **prior learning and experience** (e.g., vocabulary, general facts).
- Standard tests often fail to capture other types of intelligence.
    - **Triarchic Theory (Sternberg, 1999):** Divides intelligence into Analytical, Creative, and Practical types.
    - **Gardner (1983):** Multiple intelligences (linguistic, spatial, musical, etc.).
- **Emotional Intelligence (EI):** Ability to recognize, manage, and use emotions effectively.

#### **2. Measurement and IQ**

- **IQ (Intelligence Quotient):** Calculated as (Mental Age / Chronological Age) x 100.
- IQ scores follow a **normal distribution** with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
- **Cognitive Correlates:** Higher IQ correlates with faster mental processing speed (reaction time, inspection time) and greater **working memory capacity**.

#### **3. Roots of Intelligence (Nature and Nurture)**

- **Genetic Factors:** Intelligence is significantly **heritable** (high IQ correlation in identical twins, even when raised apart). It is polygenic.
- **Environmental Factors:** SES, education, nutrition, and enriched environments all shape intelligence.
- **Flynn Effect:** The steady **rise in IQ scores** across generations, attributed to environmental improvements (better health, education, complex modern life).

### **Part II: Scientific Research Methods (Topics 9–14)**

### **Topic 9: Scientific Reasoning**

#### **1. The Logic of Science (Approach)**

- **Belief:** An attitude towards a claim; there is **no direct connection between belief and truth**.
- **Methods to Fix Belief (Non-scientific):** Personal experience, intuition, and authority.
- **Scientific Method:** Fixes belief based on **empirical research** by combining proper reasoning (logic) and systematic empiricism (verifiable evidence).
- Science deals only with **solvable problems**.
- A scientific belief is justified if it is based on the **correct application of the scientific method**
- **Deductive Reasoning:** General rules/theory used to predict specific outcomes (A → B).
    - **Modus Ponens:** If A, then B. A is true, therefore B is true.
    - **Modus Tollens:** If A, then B. B is not true, therefore A is not true.
- **Inductive Reasoning:** Specific observations lead to broader generalizations/theories.

**3. Conditional Arguments (Syllogisms)**

- **Valid Arguments (Deduction):**
    - **Affirming the antecedent (Modus Ponens):** If A then B. A. Thus B.
    - **Denying the consequent (Modus Tollens):** **If A then B. Not B. Thus, not A**. This is the correct conclusion for the argument "If P then Q, not Q" [335 (Q39)].
- **Invalid Arguments:** Affirming the consequent and Denying the antecedent.
#### **2. Theories and Hypotheses (Most Important)**

- **Theory:** A broad set of statements explaining how variables relate. Must be **supported by data, falsifiable, and parsimonious** *(parsimonious = as simple as possible while still explaining the phenomena in question)*.
- **Hypothesis:** A **specific, testable prediction** derived from a theory.
    - **Falsifiability Criterion:** A hypothesis must be phrased such that some possible outcome could prove it false. If not falsifiable, it is not scientific.
    - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** States there is **no effect** or relationship.
    - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** States there **is an effect**.
- **Empirical Cycle (Theory-Data Cycle):** The iterative process: Theory → Hypothesis → Data Collection → Interpretation → Theory Revision/Support.
- **Operational Definitions:** Crucial for research. The **precise way a variable is defined and measured** in a study, allowing for clarity and replication.
- **Pseudoscience:** Claims that lack empirical testing, falsifiability, or peer review.

---

### **Topic 10: Validity**
- External validity (Generalization)
- Statistical validity (Effect size)
- Internal validity (Causation)
- Construct validity (Measurement precision).

**Validity** is the extent to which a test measures what it claims to measure. It is fundamental for evaluating research.

- **Psychology Goals:** Describe, predict, explain/understand, and influence/control behaviour.
- **Three Claims:**
    - **Frequency Claims:** Focus on one variable (descriptive research).
    - **Association Claims:** Focus on the relationship between two variables (correlational research).
    - **Causal Claims:** Focus on causation (experimental research).
- **Variables:**
    - **Conceptual Variable (Construct):** Abstract, theoretical level (e.g., anxiety).
    - **Operational Variable:** The specific way a construct is manipulated or measured in a study.
    - **Independent Variable (IV):** The variable that is **manipulated** (presumed cause) [175, 223, 335 (Q40)].
    - **Dependent Variable (DV):** The variable that is **measured** (presumed effect).
    - **Confounding Variables:** Variables that change simultaneously with the IV.
    - **Control Variables:** Variables held constant on purpose.
#### **Types of Validity (Crucial Definitions and Threats)**

|Validity Type|Definition (Question Answered)|Essential for Claims|Key Threats & Mitigation Strategies|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Construct Validity**|How well the **operational definition** truly captures the conceptual variable. (_Are we measuring what we think we are?_).|All claims.|**Threats:** Inadequate operational definitions, Experimenter Expectancy/Observer Bias, Social Desirability, Demand Characteristics. **Mitigation:** Use validated measurement tools, **double-blind procedures**.|
|**Internal Validity**|Extent to which the IV caused the effect in the DV, ruling out **alternative explanations (confounds)**. (_Was the IV the only cause?_).|**Causal Claims**.|**Threats:** **Design Confounds**, **Selection Effects** (non-equivalent groups), **Order Effects** (in within-groups design), Maturation, History, Attrition. **Mitigation:** **Random Assignment**, **Control Groups**, **Counterbalancing** (for order effects).|
|**External Validity**|Generalizability of results to other **populations, settings, and times**. (_Does this apply to the real world?_).|**Frequency and Association Claims**.|**Threats:** **Sampling Bias**, highly artificial settings (low ecological validity), Interaction of Time/Place/People. **Mitigation:** **Random Sampling**, Field Experiments, Replication across diverse contexts.|
|**Statistical Validity**|Accuracy of statistical conclusions, focusing on strength (**effect size**) and certainty (**significance**).|All quantitative claims.|**Threats:** Low Statistical Power (too small sample), **Type I Error** (False Positive), **Type II Error** (False Negative), unreliable measures. **Mitigation:** Adequate **sample size** (via power analysis), reporting **Effect Sizes** and **Confidence Intervals**.|
_Example of Validity Trade-off (Q42):_ An experiment using rats (high control) typically has **high internal validity** (it is easy to rule out confounds) but **low external validity** (results may not generalize to humans).

### **Topic 11: Measurement, Reliability, and Descriptive Research**

**1. Measurement Scales**

- Measurement is a systematic way to assign numbers or names to objects and their features.
- **Nominal Scale:** Differences (categorical).
- **Ordinal Scale:** Ranked order.
- **Interval Scale:** Equal intervals (addition/subtraction possible, but no true zero).
- **Ratio Scale (Q45):** Has an **absolute zero** (ratios are meaningful).
- The measurement scale determines possible statistical operations and conclusions.

**2. Reliability**

- **Reliability:** The **consistency** of measurements. Observed Score = True Score + Error Score.
- **Types of Reliability:**
    - **Test-retest reliability:** Consistency over time.
    - **Internal reliability:** Consistency across different items within a measure (e.g., Split-half reliability, Cronbach's alpha).
    - **Interrater reliability:** Consistency across different observers.
    - **Experimental reliability**.
- **Floor and Ceiling Effects:** Occur when all participants score too low (floor) or too high (ceiling) on a dependent variable, obscuring differences between groups.

#### **Descriptive Research (Approach)**

- - **Purpose:** To describe behaviour and mental processes. It yields **frequency claims**.
- **Types:** Observational research (naturalistic or lab), Surveys, and Case studies.
- **Observational Research Problems:** Observer bias, observer effects, and reactivity. Low internal validity.
- **Surveys/Polls:** Posing questions to people. Threats to construct validity include leading questions, double-barrelled questions, and negatively worded questions.
- **External Validity Threat:** Biased or unrepresentative sample (e.g., convenience or self-selection).
- **Types:** **Naturalistic Observation** (observing in natural setting), **Case Studies** (in-depth analysis of single individual/group), **Surveys** (gathering self-reported data).

---

### **Topic 12: Correlations and Experiments**

#### **1. Correlational Research (Association Claims)**

- **Purpose:** To determine the relationship between **two measured variables** (bivariate correlation).
- **Correlation Coefficient (r):** Ranges from **-1.0 (perfect negative)** to **+1.0 (perfect positive)**.
- **Limitations (Why Correlation ≠ Causation):**
    - **Directionality Problem (Temporal Precedence):** Cannot tell which variable came first or caused the other.
    - **Third-Variable Problem:** An unmeasured factor influences both variables, creating a **spurious correlation**.
- **Advanced Techniques (Attempting Causality):**
    - **Longitudinal Designs:** Measure variables over time to establish **temporal precedence** (using cross-lag correlations).
	    - Cross-lag correlations = Cross-lag correlations test whether one variable measured at an **earlier time point** predicts another variable measured at a **later time**
    - **Multiple Regression:** Statistically controls for potential third variables, strengthening the causal argument.

##### **Temporal Precedence (Advanced Correlational Techniques)**

- **Cross-Lagged-Panel Procedure:** Measures variables over time. Variable A affects Variable B if the correlation between **Variable A measured at time 1 and Variable B measured at time 2 is larger** than the correlation between Variable A measured at time 1 and Variable B measured at time 1 (which only measures the relationship at the initial time point)
#### **2. Experimental Research (Causal Claims - Approach)**

- **Purpose:** To establish a **cause-and-effect relationship** by manipulating one variable.
- **Causal Criteria:** **Covariance** (variables are related), **Temporal Precedence** (cause precedes effect), **Internal Validity** (no alternative explanations).
- **Key Variables:**
    - **Independent Variable (IV):** The variable that is **manipulated** (the presumed cause).
    - **Dependent Variable (DV):** The outcome variable that is **measured** (the presumed effect).
    - **Control Variables:** Variables kept constant to prevent confounds.
- **Controlling Bias:**
    - **Random Assignment:** Ensures groups are equivalent at the start, controlling for selection effects and confounding variables.
    - **Control Group:** Provides a baseline for comparison (no treatment/placebo).

---

### **Topic 13: Single-Factor and Factorial Designs**

#### **1. Factorial Designs (Crucial Concept)**

- Experiments involving **two or more independent variables (IVs)**.
- **Main Effect:** The overall effect of **one IV** on the DV, averaging across the levels of the other IVs.
- **Interaction Effect:** Occurs when the effect of one IV **depends on the level of another IV**. _This is the primary reason for using factorial designs._ (e.g., Caffeine only helps performance if the individual is sleep-deprived).
- **Notation:** A 2x2 design indicates two IVs, each with two levels, resulting in two main effects and one interaction.

#### **2. Design Structures (Approach)**

- **Between-subjects design (Independent-groups):** Separate groups of subjects receive different levels of the IV.
    - _Advantage:_ No chance that one IV level affects performance under another level.
    - _Disadvantage:_ Chance that groups differ. Controlled by **random assignment** or **matching**.
    - In a between-subjects design, there is no chance on **carry-over effects** but there is a chance on **group differences** [340 (Q49)].
- **Within-subjects design (Repeated-measures):** All subjects receive all levels of the IV.
    - _Advantage:_ Each subject serves as their own control (no group differences).
    - _Disadvantage:_ Chance of **order effects** (practice, carryover).
    - _Solution:_ **Counterbalancing** (Complete counterbalanced design, Latin Square design, Balanced Latin Square design, Random order).
    - A study with 4 IV levels using a balanced Latin Square design requires at least **4 subjects** [233, 342 (Q51)].
- **Mixed Factorial Design:** At least one IV is manipulated within-groups, and at least one is manipulated between-groups.

##### **Factorial Designs**

- Involves **two or more independent variables (factors)**.
- **Factorial Combination:** Each level of every IV occurs with all levels of the other IV(s).
- **Notation:** A 5 x 2 factorial between-subjects design has two factors with 5 and 2 levels, resulting in $5 \times 2 = \mathbf{10}$ groups/conditions [236, 342 (Q52)].
- **Advantages:** Efficiency, generalization, and providing information on the **interaction between factors**.
- **Effects:**
    - **Main Effect:** The overall effect of **one IV** on the DV, averaged over the levels of the other IV(s).
    - **Interaction Effect:** Occurs when the effect of one IV **depends on the level of the other IV(s)**.
        - Graphically, **no interaction** means the lines are **parallel**. If the lines are not parallel, there is an interaction.


	###### **Interpreting Factorial Results (Q53-55)**
	
	- **Q53 Analysis:
	    ![[Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 14.46.54.png]]
	    - Line A is flat (no effect of A).
	    - Line B1 is higher than B2 (main effect of B).
	    - The lines are not parallel (interaction A x B).
	    - Conclusion: **No effect of A; a main effect of B; an interaction between A and B**.

	- **Q54 Analysis:**
	![[Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 14.47.10.png]]
	- Averages for A1 and A2 are different (main effect of A).
	- Averages for B1 and B2 are different (main effect of B).
	- The lines are parallel (no interaction).
	- Conclusion: **A main effect of A; a main effect of B; no interaction between A and B**.

	- **Q55 Analysis (Data Table):**
	![[Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 14.47.31.png]]
	- Mean A1 = (4+6)/2 = 5; Mean A2 = (4+6)/2 = 5 (No main effect of A).
	- Mean B1 = (4+4)/2 = 4; Mean B2 = (6+6)/2 = 6 (Main effect of B).
	- Difference at A1: 4-6 = -2; Difference at A2: 4-6 = -2. The effect of B does not depend on A (No interaction).
	- Conclusion: **No effect of A; a main effect of B; no interaction between A and B**.

### **Topic 14: Small-N and Quasi-Experimental Designs**

#### **1. Quasi-Experimental Designs (Approach)**

- **Characteristics:** Resemble true experiments but **lack full experimental control**, specifically **random assignment**.
- **Usefulness:** Used when random assignment is unethical or impossible (e.g., studying the effects of natural events or policies).
- **Limitation:** Weaker **internal validity** because confounds are harder to rule out.

**Threat to experimental design**: **Regression to the mean** = expected return to normal following extremely high or low initial scores.
#### **2. Small-N Designs**

- **Characteristics:** Involve **in-depth analysis** of a very small number of participants (sometimes just one).
- **Approach:** Focus on individual-level data, common in clinical settings or studies of rare populations.
- **Examples:** Stable-baseline designs, Multiple-baseline designs, Reversal designs (ABA design).
	- **Reversal Designs (ABA Design)**: This design involves studying a behaviour across three phases:
		- **Phase A (Baseline):** The researcher establishes a stable baseline for the behaviour without any intervention.
		- **Phase B (Treatment):** The intervention (treatment) is introduced, and the researcher measures changes in the behaviour.
		- **Phase A (Reversal):** The intervention is withdrawn, and the researcher observes whether the behaviour reverts to the original baseline state.
		
	- **Stable-Baseline Designs:** In this design, researchers observe the behaviour for an extended **stable baseline period** before introducing the intervention.
		- *The extended baseline period rules out the possibility that the behaviour would have changed naturally without the intervention, thereby strengthening the argument for a causal relationship*
	
	- **Multiple-Baseline Designs:** This design avoids the ethical complications of reversal designs (where treatment is removed). Instead of withdrawing the treatment, the intervention is introduced at **different times** for different behaviours, settings, or individuals.

### **Summary of Critical Thinking and Bias (Important for Evaluating Questions)**

- **Critical Thinking/Amiable Skepticism:** Systematically questioning and evaluating information using well-supported evidence.
- **Key Biases to Avoid:**
    1. **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking and focusing on evidence that supports existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.
    2. **Hindsight Bias:** Believing, after an event, that you knew the outcome all along ("I knew it").
    3. **Dunning-Kruger Effect:** People with limited knowledge overestimate their competence.
    4. **Mental Shortcuts (Heuristics):** Quick rules that often lead to errors (e.g., Availability, Representativeness).
    5. **Experimenter Bias/Observer Bias:** Researcher expectations unintentionally influencing results (Controlled via **Double-Blind Procedures**).
	    - *A **Double-Blind Design** is a method where **both the participants and the experimenters** are unaware of who is receiving the treatment (the independent variable manipulation) and who is receiving the control or placebo condition*
    6. **Demand Characteristics:** Participants guess the study's purpose and change their behaviour (Controlled via **Blinding**).
    7. **Placebo Effect:** Participants improve simply because they believe they are receiving treatment (Controlled via **Placebo Control Groups**).

### **Ethical Considerations in Research**

These principles must be applied to any research question involving participants.

- **Informed Consent:** Participants must be fully informed of the study's nature and risks before agreeing to participate.
- **Confidentiality:** Researchers must protect participants' privacy and data.
- **Debriefing:** Required after the study is completed to explain the true purpose and address any deception used.
- **Minimizing Harm:** Researchers must ensure participants are protected from physical or psychological harm (e.g., lessons from Stanford Prison Experiment, Milgram’s Obedience Experiment).


## Genereal / Random Notes

The course is divided into two sections: Genetic/Biological Basis of Behaviour (Weeks 1-4, Topics 1-8) and Scientific Research Methods (Weeks 5-7, Topics 9-14). The final exam counts for **90% of your total grade**.

The conjunction fallacy is ==a cognitive bias where a person mistakenly judges that two events occurring together are more probable than a single event alone==

What type of scale is a Likert scale?

- Nominal: Categories with no order (e.g., male/female, apple/orange).
    
    ❌ Not applicable — Likert has an order.
    
- Ordinal: Ordered categories, but differences between ranks are not necessarily equal.
    
    ✅ This is what a Likert scale is — we can say 4 > 2 (more agreement), but we can’t say it’s “twice as much.”
    
- Interval: Equal intervals between points, but no true zero (e.g., temperature in °C).
    
    ❌ Some researchers treat Likert data as interval for statistical convenience, but technically it’s ordinal.
    
- Ratio: Equal intervals and a true zero (e.g., height, weight, reaction time).
    
    ❌ Definitely not applicable.


==Photoreceptor density varies significantly across the retina, with the highest density in the fovea, which contains almost exclusively cones for sharp, detailed vision==. Rods are most abundant in a ring surrounding the fovea, with their density decreasing towards the periphery, while cone density is very low in the far periphery. The fovea itself has the highest concentration of photoreceptors, while the [optic disc](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enCZ969CZ970&cs=0&sca_esv=b1f7e2cc7f09216f&sxsrf=AE3TifN0_q089eVH6_2IfCc18NgmUZB-dg%3A1760951101086&q=optic+disc&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT8seGtrKQAxXsgf0HHSydGqYQxccNegQICBAB&mstk=AUtExfClqBFb5znzlftVJyF7jcWvbrQsc3aQwHRSU_Bb5iCLZdOT3FjZCSy8EXlOrDycWou6cnzeG8vHasR9aGP0c0Eaj0YH7ifJo6SzKdNW44V6Pu31lu3ugC1cQNVWqKWrLrq7ieOUckdQ37nvvK-B3O0evg3GGYZ8Obo9-MsSplydMmY&csui=3) has none, creating the [blind spot](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enCZ969CZ970&cs=0&sca_esv=b1f7e2cc7f09216f&sxsrf=AE3TifN0_q089eVH6_2IfCc18NgmUZB-dg%3A1760951101086&q=blind+spot&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT8seGtrKQAxXsgf0HHSydGqYQxccNegQICBAC&mstk=AUtExfClqBFb5znzlftVJyF7jcWvbrQsc3aQwHRSU_Bb5iCLZdOT3FjZCSy8EXlOrDycWou6cnzeG8vHasR9aGP0c0Eaj0YH7ifJo6SzKdNW44V6Pu31lu3ugC1cQNVWqKWrLrq7ieOUckdQ37nvvK-B3O0evg3GGYZ8Obo9-MsSplydMmY&csui=3).


**Latent Learning** = learning involves the creation of a cognitive map (mental representation) that may not be demonstrated until motivation is introduced


##### Overview of sleep stages (Non-REM and REM):

- N1: Lightest stage of sleep — easy to wake up, drifting between wakefulness and sleep.
    
- N2: Deeper than N1 — sleep spindles and K-complexes appear, body temperature drops.
    
- N3: Deepest stage of Non-REM sleep, also called slow-wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep.
    
- REM: Brain is highly active, vivid dreaming occurs, body is paralyzed.


#### Latin & Balanced Latin Square Design
In a within-subjects design, every participant experiences all levels of the independent variable — here, 4 levels (A, B, C, D).

However, the order in which participants experience the conditions can cause order effects (like practice or fatigue).

To control for these, researchers use counterbalancing techniques, one of which is the Balanced Latin Square design.

---

2. What is a Balanced Latin Square?

A Latin Square ensures that:

- Each condition appears once in each ordinal position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.).
    
A Balanced Latin Square goes further — it ensures that:

- Each condition precedes and follows every other condition equally often across participants.
    
---

3. The rule for a Balanced Latin Square:

- If the number of conditions (N) is even, you need 2N participants to balance the order of conditions completely.
    
- If N is odd, you only need N participants (since the reverse order balances it automatically).



**The Hawthorne effect** is the tendency for individuals to change or improve their behavior when they know they are being observed.

**Weber's law** is a psychological principle that states ==the smallest detectable difference between two stimuli is a constant proportion of the original stimulus intensity==.

Non-equivalent control group design = groups that differ before manipulation
