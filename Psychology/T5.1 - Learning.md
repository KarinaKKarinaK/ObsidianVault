**Learning Definition:**

- Learning is a relatively enduring change in behavior resulting from experience​. It allows animals and humans to adapt to their environments by understanding predictive associations between stimuli or actions and their consequences.

### **Types of Learning**

1. %% fold %% **Non-associative Learning**​:
    - The simplest form of learning, which occurs after repeated exposure to a single stimulus. This can either lead to habituation (a decrease in response) or sensitization (an increase in response).
    
    - **Habituation:** Decrease in behavioral response after repeated exposure to a stimulus. This happens when the stimulus is neither harmful nor rewarding. For example, you may stop noticing sirens in a busy city after a while​.
	    - Dishabituation is the **recovery of a previously habituated response** when there is a change in the stimulus or the environment. 
	    - Dishabituation is crucial in survival situations because it allows organisms to respond to changes in the environment that could signal new threats or opportunities.
	
    
    - **Sensitization:** Increase in behavioral response after exposure to a stimulus, often something threatening or painful. This heightens awareness of other stimuli.
	    - Desensitization is the **reduction of sensitivity** to a stimulus after repeated exposure, particularly with stimuli that initially caused a strong reaction.
	    - Desensitization is especially useful in reducing anxiety or fear responses to non-harmful stimuli, such as phobias or PTSD treatment.
    
2. %% fold %% **Associative Learning**​:
    
    - Learning the relationship between two stimuli or events that are linked together, often through conditioning (either classical or operant).
        
    - **Classical Conditioning** (Pavlovian Conditioning):
        
        - A neutral stimulus becomes associated with a response after being paired with a stimulus that naturally produces that response. For instance, Pavlov's dogs learned to associate the sound of a metronome with food, eventually salivating at the sound alone.
        
        - Key components include:
            - **Unconditioned Stimulus (US):** A stimulus that naturally triggers a response (e.g., food).
            - **Unconditioned Response (UR):** A natural, unlearned reaction to the US (e.g., salivation).
            - **Conditioned Stimulus (CS):** A previously neutral stimulus that, after association with the US, elicits a response.
            - **Conditioned Response (CR):** A learned response to the CS (e.g., salivation in response to the metronome).
        
    - **Operant Conditioning** (Instrumental Conditioning):
        
        - Learning through consequences (rewards or punishments). Behavior is influenced by the outcomes of actions. 
	        - For example, a rat pressing a lever to receive food learns that this action leads to a desirable consequence (food).
        - **Law of Effect** (Thorndike): Behaviors followed by favorable consequences become more likely to be repeated, while those followed by unfavorable consequences become less likely​.
    
3. %% fold %% **Observational Learning**​:
    
    - Learning that occurs by watching the behavior of others. This is also called social learning. An example would be a child learning to imitate their parents' actions​.
