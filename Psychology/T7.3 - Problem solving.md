Problem-solving is the cognitive process of working through challenges to achieve a goal.

### **Problem-Solving Process**

**1. Problem Identification**

- %% fold %% A problem exists when there is a gap between the current state and a desired goal state. 
	- For example, if you want to travel abroad but don’t have a passport, the gap is the problem that needs to be solved.

**2. Goal-Directed Thinking**

- Problem-solving is a deliberate and goal-oriented process where you start from an initial state and move toward a goal state.

### **Obstacles to Problem Solving**

**1. Complexity**:

- The complexity of a problem can make it difficult to identify the steps needed to solve it. Complex problems often require breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subgoals.

**2. Mental Set**:

- %% fold %% **Mental Set** is the tendency to stick with strategies that have worked in the past, even when they may not be appropriate for the current problem.
    - **Example**: In Luchins’ Water Jar problem, participants developed a mental set that led them to continue using a complex solution even when a simpler solution was available.

**3. Functional Fixedness**:

- %% fold %% **Functional Fixedness** is the tendency to think of objects only in terms of their typical functions, which can hinder finding creative solutions.
    - **Example**: In Duncker’s Candle Problem, participants had difficulty using a box of tacks as a stand for the candle because they were fixated on its typical function as a container.

### **Strategies to Overcome Obstacles**

**1. Breaking Problems into Subgoals**:

- %% fold %% One effective problem-solving strategy is breaking a problem into smaller steps or subgoals. This strategy helps to simplify complex problems by focusing on solving each part sequentially.
    - **Example**: In the Tower of Hanoi problem, solving the puzzle requires the player to move disks between pegs in steps, each representing a subgoal leading to the final solution.

**2. Restructuring the Problem**:

- %% fold %% Restructuring involves changing the way a problem is represented mentally, which can lead to a new and insightful solution.
    - **Example**: In Scheerer’s Nine-Dot problem, the solution required participants to "think outside the box" and realize that they didn’t need to keep the lines within the square formed by the dots.

**3. Using Analogies**:

- %% fold %% **Analogical Problem Solving** involves applying a solution from a similar, previously solved problem to the current problem.
    - **Example**: The fortress and laser problem. A general divides his army to approach a fortress from multiple directions to avoid triggering mines, which inspired a solution to treat a tumor using multiple low-intensity lasers to avoid damaging healthy tissue.

**4. Algorithms**:

- %% fold %% An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure that guarantees a correct solution if followed properly. Algorithms are especially useful for solving well-defined problems.
    - **Example**: Using a formula to calculate the area of a rectangle is an algorithm.

**5. Working Backward**:

- %% fold %% This strategy involves starting from the goal state and working back to the current state to identify the necessary steps to solve the problem.
    - **Example**: The water lily problem involves reasoning backward to determine that if the lake is fully covered on day 60, it must be half-covered on day 59 because the water lilies double in area every day.

**6. Sudden Insight**:

- %% fold %% Sometimes, solutions come from an "Aha!" moment, or sudden insight, where the problem solver suddenly sees the solution after a period of thinking or struggling.
    - **Example**: In Köhler’s chimpanzee study, the chimp suddenly realized it could combine two sticks to make a longer tool to reach a banana, demonstrating insight-based problem-solving.

### **Common Barriers in Problem Solving**

**1. Mental Set**:

- Refers to relying on solutions that have worked in the past, even when they are not the most effective for the current problem.

**2. Functional Fixedness**:

- The tendency to see objects as functioning only in their usual way, which prevents problem solvers from considering alternative uses.

**3. Perceptual Set**:

- A predisposition to perceive things in a certain way, which can interfere with problem solving if the solver is unable to see the problem from a different perspective.
