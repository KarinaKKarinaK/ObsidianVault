## Brain plasticity 

- **Plasticity** refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt, both structurally and functionally, in response to experience and damage.

	- The brain is shaped by both **genetic factors** and **experiences**. This ability to reorganize neural connections is vital for learning, memory, and recovery from brain injuries.

**A. Types of Plasticity**

1. **Developmental plasticity**: Occurs during **childhood** as the brain grows and changes rapidly in response to the environment and learning experiences.
2. **Adaptive plasticity**: The brain’s capacity to **compensate for damage** by reorganizing its structure and function. For instance, if a specific region of the brain is injured, other parts of the brain may take over its functions.
3. **Experience-dependent plasticity**: Long-term changes in the brain based on **repeated experiences**. For example, learning to play an instrument can lead to structural changes in the brain's motor areas.

**B. Critical Periods:**

- **Critical Periods** refer to specific times in early life when the brain is particularly sensitive to environmental stimuli. Skills like **language acquisition** are highly dependent on being exposed to relevant stimuli during these periods.

**C. Synaptic Pruning:**

- **Synaptic Pruning** is the process where the brain eliminates unused synaptic connections and strengthens those that are frequently used. This process improves the efficiency of the brain by removing redundant or less efficient neural pathways.


- The brain is divided into **two hemispheres**: the **left** and the **right**, which are connected by the **corpus callosum**. Each hemisphere has specialized functions, a phenomenon known as **lateralization**.


## Brain's hemisperes 

**A. Left Hemisphere**

- Primarily responsible for:
	- **Language** processing, including **speaking, writing, reading**, and **comprehension**.
	- **Logical reasoning**, **mathematical abilities**, and **analytical tasks**.
	- Complex **motor behaviors** like precise movements.

**B. Right Hemisphere**

- Primarily responsible for:
	- **Spatial abilities**, such as the ability to **visualize objects in space** or navigate.
	- **Facial recognition** and processing of **emotions**.
	- **Musical ability** and perception of melodies.
	- Some **memory tasks**, especially those involving **nonverbal** or **context-free** information.


**C. Hemispheric Specialization**

- Most tasks require **both hemispheres** to work together. For example, while the **left hemisphere** may handle language production, the **right hemisphere** is involved in understanding **tone** and **context** in speech.


**D. Split-Brain Studies**

- **Split-brain surgery** involves cutting the **corpus callosum**, often to treat severe epilepsy. This results in the two hemispheres being **unable to communicate** with each other.

- **Key Findings**:

	- When images are presented to the **right visual field** (processed by the left hemisphere), patients can **verbally identify** what they saw.
	- When images are presented to the **left visual field** (processed by the right hemisphere), patients **cannot verbalize** what they saw, but they can **select the correct object** with their **left hand**, showing that the right hemisphere recognized the image.
	- These studies demonstrated the **independence** of each hemisphere and the **specialized functions** they perform.


**E. Interpreter Phenomenon**

• The **left hemisphere** often acts as an "interpreter," trying to explain or make sense of actions taken by the **right hemisphere**. For example, if the right hemisphere causes the left hand to pick up an object (in a split-brain patient), the left hemisphere might create a plausible explanation even though it doesn't have the full information.
