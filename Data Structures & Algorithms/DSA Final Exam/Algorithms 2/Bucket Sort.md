- Worst-case time complexity happens when very uneven distribution (everything goes into one bucket)
- In that case, bucket sort gives no improvements, and the $\Theta(n^2)$ time complexity of insertion sort is preserved.
- Worst-case time complexity can be improved by using a different secondary sorting algorithm.
