***Typical trade-off when building AI agents: development speed vs flexibility.***
- **Fast development -->** easy-to-use, low-code platforms or pre-built products: these are fast to implemeny but give you less control (better for just standard problems)
- **Flexibility -->** highly flexible frameworks or the option to build everything from scratch: maximum ability to customize, m=but rquire more development resources and deep technical expertise
##### Core Components For Building AI Agents:

- **Agent development kit =>** open-source, code-first, toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents
- **Model context protocol =>** open protocol that standardizes how applications provide content to LLMs
- **Vertex AI agent engine =>** managed platform to deploy, manage, and scale AI agents in production
- **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol =>** open standard designed to enable communication and collaboration between AI agents
