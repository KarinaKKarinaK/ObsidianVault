### `Big-O Analysis`

##### Asymptotic Notation (Ch. 2)

- **Big-O (`O`)**: Upper bound – algorithm never worse than this (like ≤).
    
- **Big-Ω (`Ω`)**: Lower bound – algorithm never better than this (like ≥).
    
- **Big-Θ (`Θ`)**: Tight bound – algorithm always scales like this (like =).
    
##### Analogy:

- O = “at most”; Big-O means "less than or equal to (<=)"
    
- Ω = “at least”; Big-Omega means "greater or equal to (>=)"
    
- Θ = “exactly this growth”; Big-Theta means "equal to (=)"
