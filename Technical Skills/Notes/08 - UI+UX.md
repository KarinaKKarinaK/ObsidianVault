## UI vs UX

|UI (User Interface)|UX (User Experience)|
|---|---|
|How it looks|How it feels|
|Visual design|Interaction & flow|
|Colors, fonts, layout|Ease, clarity, satisfaction|
Design starts with the **user**, not the interface.

**Core steps:**
1. Understand users; their **user needs, pain points, and behavior**
2. Define problems
3. Design solutions
4. Test & iterate

## Key Concepts

#### **Information Architecture (IA)**
- Organizing content logically
- Clear navigation
- Predictable structure

#### **UX Heuristics**
**Heuristics** are usability rules used to **evaluate interfaces**.

**Key principles of US heuristics:**
- Visibility of system status
- Consistency & standards
- Error prevention
- User control & freedom
- Recognition over recall

#### Visual Hierarchy

- Size
- Color
- Contrast
- Spacing

**Goal = Guide the user’s attention.**

#### Accessibility
**Accessibility** means designing for **everyone**, including users with disabilities.

**Key principles of accessibility:**
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Sufficient color contrast
- Clear labels & focus states

Standards ==> WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

#### Microinteractions

- Button hover states
- Loading indicators
- Error messages

Purpose ==> Provide feedback and reduce confusion.

### Design Systems

A **design system** is a shared set of:

- Components
- Styles
- Rules

**It includes:**

- Buttons
- Forms
- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing tokens

**The benefits:**

- Consistency
- Faster development
- Better collaboration
- Scalable design

--> Design systems connect **design and engineering**.

## Performance Optimization

**Performance is part of UX.**

**Key ideas:**
- Fast load times
- Responsive interactions
- Minimal layout shifts

**UX impact:**

- Users leave slow products
- Speed affects trust & satisfaction

**Techniques:**

- Optimize images
- Reduce UI complexity
- Lazy loading
- Avoid unnecessary animations


## Testing

#### Usability Testing

- Task-based testing
    
- Observe user behavior
    
- Identify friction points

#### A/B Testing

- Compare two designs
    
- Measure real user behavior
