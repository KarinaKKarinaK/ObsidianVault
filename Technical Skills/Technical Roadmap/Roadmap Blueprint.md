I want to create a 2-month roadmap/study plan to master my technical skills, I am an AI/software developer for a startup which uses the following tech stack/needs strong skills and both technical and practical knwoledge in JS, database, system design, UI/UXm, and so on, as well as implementing Nextjs, React, DevOps and so on. Now, I want you to create a super detailed roadmap for me to achieve mastery in these skills. For example: Week 1 = foundations (watch videos on topics/programming languages/concepts/skills XYZ on skill Y full-attention, take notes in the form of a mind-map on your iPad) + one video from CodingJesus/etc per day (for mindset and developing the ideas around programming and CS) + every day do one LeetCode problem using C++, then Week 2 = 3 small to medium sized projects (give me a breakdown of each project and which tech stack it will use) + make sur ethe projects are meaningful so that they also look good on my GitHub "portfolio" as a repository + also watch videos XYZ on 123, Week 3 = 2 Big projects + start ML course by Microsoft , Week 4.... (be very very very specific on exactly whcih topics to study (+ all of their subtopics), how to best approach each topic (watching videos + taking notes etc) + how to take notes (e.g. mind maps or on Obsidian etc), thsi should be a masterdy, super detailed roadmap
