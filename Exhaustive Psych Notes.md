## **Introduction to Psychology and its Methods AI: Comprehensive Exam Notes**

The course is divided into two sections: Genetic/Biological Basis of Behaviour (Weeks 1-4, Topics 1-8) and Scientific Research Methods (Weeks 5-7, Topics 9-14). The final exam counts for **90% of your total grade**.

### **Part I: Genetic and Biological Basis of Behaviour (Topics 1–8)**

### **Topic 1: Genes and Evolution**

#### **1. Core Concepts and Definitions**

- **Psychological Science:** The **scientific study of mind, brain, and behaviour**.
- **Mind/Body Problem:** Modern psychology rejects **dualism** (mind and body are separate) and agrees that the mind arises from **brain activity**.
- **Nature vs. Nurture:** Both genetics (nature) and environment (nurture) **continuously interact** to shape behaviour.
- **Genome:** The entire set of genes in an organism, acting as the blueprint.
- **Genotype:** The **genetic makeup** of an individual, determined at conception and constant throughout life.
- **Phenotype:** The **observable traits and behaviours** resulting from the interaction between genotype and environment.
    - _Example:_ Height is determined by genetics (genotype) but influenced by nutrition (environment).
- **Polygenic Traits:** Most human traits (e.g., intelligence) are influenced by **multiple genes and environmental factors**.

#### **2. Gene Expression and Environment (Most Important)**

- **Gene Expression:** Genes must be **activated** (expressed) for their effects to be visible. This is regulated by biochemical and environmental influences (e.g., stress, nutrition, social experiences).
- **Methylation:** A biochemical process that can modify gene activity (often suppressing it) without changing the DNA structure.
- **Epigenetics:** The study of how **environmental factors** (like stress or diet) influence gene expression, turning genes on or off, without altering the genetic code itself.

#### **3. Behavioural Genetics and Heritability**

- **Behavioural Genetics:** Studies the interaction between genetics and environment to explain behaviour.
- **Heritability Estimate:** A statistical measure (ranging from 0 to 1) of how much of the **variation in a trait within a population** is due to genetics.
    - _**Important:**_ Heritability applies to **populations**, not individuals.
- **Research Methods (Approach):**
    - **Twin Studies:** Compares monozygotic (100% genes shared) and dizygotic (50% genes shared) twins. If identical twins are more similar, it suggests a strong genetic influence.
    - **Adoption Studies:** Compares adopted children to both biological and adoptive parents to separate genetic and environmental influences.

#### **4. Evolution and Natural Selection**

- **Natural Selection (Darwin):** The core mechanism of evolution. Traits that improve survival and reproduction are passed on.
- **Three Conditions for Natural Selection:** 1. **Variation** in traits, 2. **Differential survival and reproduction**, 3. **Heritability** of advantageous traits.
- **Evolutionary Psychology:** Focuses on how natural selection shapes psychological traits (e.g., forming social bonds for survival).

- **Action Potential:** The electrical impulse traveling down the axon. Governed by the **All-or-None Law** (it either fires or it doesn't; strength is constant).
- **Synapse:** The gap between neurons where communication occurs via **neurotransmitters (NTs)**.
    - NTs generate either an **excitatory** (increases firing likelihood) or **inhibitory** (decreases firing likelihood) signal.
- **NT Termination (The process of stopping the signal):** 1. **Autoreceptors** (signal stop of release), 2. **Synaptic Reuptake** (reabsorption by presynaptic neuron), 3. **Enzyme Deactivation** (breakdown in the synapse).

- **Associative Learning:** Learning the relationship between two stimuli or events.
- **Observational Learning:** Learning by watching others (social learning).

#### **2. Classical Conditioning (Pavlovian)**

- A neutral stimulus becomes associated with a response after being paired with a stimulus that naturally produces that response.
- **Key Components:**
    - **Unconditioned Stimulus (US):** Naturally triggers a response (e.g., food).
    - **Unconditioned Response (UR):** Natural, unlearned reaction (e.g., salivation to food).
    - **Conditioned Stimulus (CS):** Previously neutral, now elicits a response (e.g., metronome sound).
    - **Conditioned Response (CR):** Learned response to the CS (e.g., salivation to the sound).
- **Rescorla-Wagner Model (Cognitive Approach):** Emphasizes **prediction**. The strength of the CR depends on how well the CS **predicts** the US.
    - **Blocking:** Prior learning of one CS-US association prevents the learning of a new one.

#### **3. Operant Conditioning (Instrumental Conditioning - Most Important)**

- **Superstitious Behaviour:** Occurs when a behaviour is accidentally reinforced (Skinner’s pigeons).

#### **4. Schedules of Reinforcement (Crucial for Resistance to Extinction)**

- **Continuous Reinforcement:** Every instance is rewarded (fast learning, fast extinction).
- **Partial (Intermittent) Reinforcement:** Rewards are intermittent; leads to behaviours **more resistant to extinction**.
    - **Fixed Ratio (FR):** Reward after set number of responses.
    - **Variable Ratio (VR):** Reward after varying number of responses (highest response rate, e.g., slot machines).
    - **Fixed Interval (FI):** Reward after set time period.
    - **Variable Interval (VI):** Reward after varying time period.

#### **5. Cognitive and Social Learning**

- **Latent Learning:** Learning that occurs **without reinforcement** and is only demonstrated once reinforcement becomes available.
- **Cognitive Maps (Tolman):** Mental representations of spatial layouts, formed via latent learning.
- **Learned Helplessness:** Passive behaviour learned after experiencing uncontrollable negative events, leading to the belief that outcomes cannot be influenced.
- **Observational Learning (Bandura):** Learning by watching others (modeling).
    - **Vicarious Learning:** Learning by watching others receive reinforcement or punishment.
    - **Mirror Neurons:** Activate when performing an action and when observing others perform it, likely facilitating imitation.

- **Deductive Reasoning:** General rules/theory used to predict specific outcomes (A → B).
    - **Modus Ponens:** If A, then B. A is true, therefore B is true.
    - **Modus Tollens:** If A, then B. B is not true, therefore A is not true.
- **Inductive Reasoning:** Specific observations lead to broader generalizations/theories.

#### **2. Theories and Hypotheses (Most Important)**

|Validity Type|Definition (Question Answered)|Essential for Claims|Key Threats & Mitigation Strategies|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Construct Validity**|How well the **operational definition** truly captures the conceptual variable. (_Are we measuring what we think we are?_).|All claims.|**Threats:** Inadequate operational definitions, Experimenter Expectancy/Observer Bias, Social Desirability, Demand Characteristics. **Mitigation:** Use validated measurement tools, **double-blind procedures**.|

    - **Test–retest reliability:** Consistency over time.
    - **Inter-rater reliability:** Consistency across different observers.
- **Floor and Ceiling Effects:** Occur when all participants score too low (floor) or too high (ceiling) on a dependent variable, obscuring differences between groups.

#### **Descriptive Research (Approach)**

- **Purpose:** To observe and describe behaviour without manipulating variables. It describes, but **does not explain** causation.
- **Types:** **Naturalistic Observation** (observing in natural setting), **Case Studies** (in-depth analysis of single individual/group), **Surveys** (gathering self-reported data).

---

### **Topic 12: Correlations and Experiments**

#### **1. Correlational Research (Association Claims)**

- **Purpose:** To determine the relationship between **two measured variables** (bivariate correlation).
- **Correlation Coefficient (r):** Ranges from **-1.0 (perfect negative)** to **+1.0 (perfect positive)**.
- **Limitations (Why Correlation ≠ Causation):**
    - **Directionality Problem (Temporal Precedence):** Cannot tell which variable came first or caused the other.
    - **Third-Variable Problem:** An unmeasured factor influences both variables, creating a **spurious correlation**.
- **Advanced Techniques (Attempting Causality):**
    - **Longitudinal Designs:** Measure variables over time to establish **temporal precedence** (using cross-lag correlations).
    - **Multiple Regression:** Statistically controls for potential third variables, strengthening the causal argument.

#### **2. Experimental Research (Causal Claims - Approach)**

- **Purpose:** To establish a **cause-and-effect relationship** by manipulating one variable.
- **Causal Criteria:** **Covariance** (variables are related), **Temporal Precedence** (cause precedes effect), **Internal Validity** (no alternative explanations).
- **Key Variables:**
    - **Independent Variable (IV):** The variable that is **manipulated** (the presumed cause).
    - **Dependent Variable (DV):** The outcome variable that is **measured** (the presumed effect).
    - **Control Variables:** Variables kept constant to prevent confounds.
- **Controlling Bias:**
    - **Random Assignment:** Ensures groups are equivalent at the start, controlling for selection effects and confounding variables.
    - **Control Group:** Provides a baseline for comparison (no treatment/placebo).

---

### **Topic 13: Single-Factor and Factorial Designs**

#### **1. Factorial Designs (Crucial Concept)**

- Experiments involving **two or more independent variables (IVs)**.
- **Main Effect:** The overall effect of **one IV** on the DV, averaging across the levels of the other IVs.
- **Interaction Effect:** Occurs when the effect of one IV **depends on the level of another IV**. _This is the primary reason for using factorial designs._ (e.g., Caffeine only helps performance if the individual is sleep-deprived).
- **Notation:** A 2x2 design indicates two IVs, each with two levels, resulting in two main effects and one interaction.

#### **2. Design Structures (Approach)**

- **Between-Groups Design:** Different participants are in each condition.
- **Within-Groups Design:** The **same participants** experience **all conditions**.
    - _**Problem:**_ Risk of **Order Effects** (practice/fatigue).
    - _**Solution:**_ **Counterbalancing** (varying the order of conditions).
- **Mixed Factorial Design:** At least one IV is manipulated within-groups, and at least one is manipulated between-groups.

---

### **Topic 14: Small-N and Quasi-Experimental Designs**

#### **1. Quasi-Experimental Designs (Approach)**

- **Characteristics:** Resemble true experiments but **lack full experimental control**, specifically **random assignment**.
- **Usefulness:** Used when random assignment is unethical or impossible (e.g., studying the effects of natural events or policies).
- **Limitation:** Weaker **internal validity** because confounds are harder to rule out.

#### **2. Small-N Designs**

- **Characteristics:** Involve **in-depth analysis** of a very small number of participants (sometimes just one).
- **Approach:** Focus on individual-level data, common in clinical settings or studies of rare populations.
- **Examples:** Stable-baseline designs, Multiple-baseline designs, Reversal designs (ABA design).

---

### **Summary of Critical Thinking and Bias (Important for Evaluating Questions)**

- **Critical Thinking/Amiable Skepticism:** Systematically questioning and evaluating information using well-supported evidence.
- **Key Biases to Avoid:**
    1. **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking and focusing on evidence that supports existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.
    2. **Hindsight Bias:** Believing, after an event, that you knew the outcome all along ("I knew it").
    3. **Dunning-Kruger Effect:** People with limited knowledge overestimate their competence.
    4. **Mental Shortcuts (Heuristics):** Quick rules that often lead to errors (e.g., Availability, Representativeness).
    5. **Experimenter Bias/Observer Bias:** Researcher expectations unintentionally influencing results (Controlled via **Double-Blind Procedures**).
    6. **Demand Characteristics:** Participants guess the study's purpose and change their behaviour (Controlled via **Blinding**).
    7. **Placebo Effect:** Participants improve simply because they believe they are receiving treatment (Controlled via **Placebo Control Groups**).

### **Ethical Considerations in Research**

These principles must be applied to any research question involving participants.

- **Informed Consent:** Participants must be fully informed of the study's nature and risks before agreeing to participate.
- **Confidentiality:** Researchers must protect participants' privacy and data.
- **Debriefing:** Required after the study is completed to explain the true purpose and address any deception used.
- **Minimizing Harm:** Researchers must ensure participants are protected from physical or psychological harm (e.g., lessons from Stanford Prison Experiment, Milgram’s Obedience Experiment).
