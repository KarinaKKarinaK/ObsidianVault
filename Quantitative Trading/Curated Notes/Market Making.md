**Bid** = Price at which someone is willing to buy
**Ask / Offer** = Price at which someone is willing to sell
**(Bid - Ask): Spread** = The difference between the bid price versus the ask price; spread = offer - bid
**Lot (size)** = Quantity of the bid and ask, defines the size of the trade

**Market Maker (MM)** = Anyone willing to show a bid or offer for a product
**Market Taker (MT)** = all other participants

Generally **MMs** provide **quotes** which consist of one bid and one offer. Usually, quotes can't be wider than predefined spread.
- Since the quotes have limited size (defined by the MM), only the fastest trader gets to trade on the prices.
- Typically traders (both MMs and MTs) have a **position limit**; which means that they can't have a position more than a certain amount of lots (long or short).
	- Its eaiser for an MT to stay within his position limit than for an MM because the MT actively trades in and out of positions depending on his opinion.
	- Meanwhile, MMs must be careful when managing their positions, they an do this by adjusting the prices and the amount of lots they quote.
