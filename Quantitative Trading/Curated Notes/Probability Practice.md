Here are **50 Optiver-style probability drills**, exactly in the format and difficulty they ask during cognitive interviews.

They are **short**, **fast-thinking**, and **EV/conditional-logic heavy** — the type traders use daily.

I grouped them by category so you can drill systematically.

# ✅ **SECTION 1 — Basic Probability (10 questions)**

1. A fair die: What is (P(\text{rolling ≥ 5}))?

3. Two fair coins flipped: (P(\text{at least one head}))?
    
4. You roll two dice. (P(\text{sum = 7}))?
    
5. You roll two dice. (P(\text{sum even}))?

# ✅ **SECTION 2 — Conditional Probability (10 questions)**

11. Two cards drawn _without replacement_ from a deck.  
    (P(\text{second card is ace} \mid \text{first is ace}))?
    
12. A bag: 4 blue, 6 green. A blue is drawn and _not replaced_.  
    (P(\text{second blue}))?
    
13. Two dice are rolled.  
    Given the first die is 6, (P(\text{sum ≥ 10}))?
    
14. Card drawn is red.  
    (P(\text{it is hearts} \mid \text{red}))?
    
15. Probability of rain is 40%.  
    Given it rains, probability of traffic jam is 70%.  
    Find: (P(\text{rain ∩ jam})).
    
16. A factory has 90% good machines, 10% bad.  
    Good machines produce defects 1% of time, bad produce 10%.  
    Given a product is defective, find (P(\text{machine was bad})).
    
17. You roll two dice.  
    Given at least one is 4, (P(\text{sum ≥ 8}))?
    
18. A survey: 60% like coffee, 45% like both coffee and tea.  
    (P(\text{tea} | \text{coffee}))?
    
19. Deck of 52.  
    Given card is a face card, (P(\text{it is a Jack}))?
    
20. Draw 2 marbles from bag: 5 white, 5 black.  
    Given first is white, (P(\text{2nd is same color}))?

# ✅ **SECTION 3 — Expected Value (10 questions)**

21. You win $10 with p=0.3, lose $5 otherwise. EV?
    
22. Coin: heads pays +20, tails −12. EV?
    
23. A game: roll die. If ≥5, you win 2× your bet; else you lose your bet.  
    Find fair multiplier m so game’s EV = 0.
    
24. A biased die with p(6)=0.2.  
    If 6 → win 15, else lose 5. EV?
    
25. Event happens with p=30%.  
    What payout do you need for EV = 0 if you bet $10?
    
26. A lottery: 1/100 chance to win $500. Ticket costs $6. EV?
    
27. Pick random number 1–10. If even: +8, if odd: −5. EV?
    
28. A machine fails with 2% probability per hour.  
    Cost of failure = $1000. Expected cost per hour?
    
29. Coin biased p(heads)=0.55.  
    You win $3 on heads and lose $2 on tails. EV?
    
30. A box has 3 tickets: +100, −50, +20. All equally likely. EV?

# ✅ **SECTION 4 — Bayes Theorem (10 questions)**

31. Two coins: fair and biased (P(H)=0.8).  
    Flip once, you observe heads.  
    Probability you picked biased?
    
32. A disease affects 1% of population. Test is 95% accurate (both ways).  
    Patient tests positive. (P(\text{disease}))?
    
33. You hear a rumor from a friend.  
    He tells truth 70%.  
    Rumor has prior chance 40%.  
    Given he says it’s true, find posterior.
    
34. Car manufacturer:  
    80% cars from plant A (5% defect),  
    20% from plant B (10% defect).  
    Given defect, prob from B?
    
35. Email classification:  
    Spam rate = 10%.  
    P(keyword|spam)=0.6, P(keyword|not spam)=0.05.  
    Given keyword appears, P(spam)?
    
36. Machine good 95%. Good → error 2%.  
    Bad → error 20%.  
    Given error, P(bad)?
    
37. You roll a die → if even use fair coin; if odd use biased coin (P(H)=0.7).  
    You flip and get heads.  
    What is P(coin was biased)?
    
38. Box A: 90% white balls. Box B: 40% white.  
    Pick box at random; draw white.  
    P(Box A)?
    
39. Trader buys aggressively from your ask.  
    Prior: 50M true value ±10M, symmetric.  
    Likelihood: aggressive buy means probability value > your ask = 70%.  
    Compute posterior value direction (qualitative).
    
40. A test for cheating:  
    False-positive=5%, false-negative=2%.  
    Prior cheating rate=1%.  
    Student fails test. Probability cheating?
