**Technical-study roadmap** specifically tailored for Optiver’s **cognitive + technical interviews for Quantitative Trading Internship**.  
This is exactly what you should place into your **new Obsidian folder**, divided into vault sections and subnotes.

It covers:  
• Math  
• Probability  
• Game theory  
• Mental math  
• Trading concepts  
• Market microstructure  
• Options theory  
• Risk  
• Brain-teasers  
• Speed drills  
• Simulation practice  
• Recommended exercises for each topic

Two weeks is sufficient **if you study in a focused, structured way**, exactly like this.
