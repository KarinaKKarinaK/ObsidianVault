Hi X,
I’m Karina, and I’m currently preparing for interviews for an internship at Optiver. I noticed you’ve interned there and therefore wanted to reach out, apologies in advance if it seems a bit random :) I’d really appreciate any insights you could share on:
- preparing for the behavioral and technical interviews,
- what the office  environment is like,
- and your experience with the learning culture and training at Optiver.

Any brief advice or perspective would be extremely helpful. Thank you in advance.
