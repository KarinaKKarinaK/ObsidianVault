2. What Is a Quant Trader? How Does It Differ From a “Trader”?
    

---

**Quant Trader at Optiver**  
A quant trader is someone who:  
• Makes decisions based on probabilities, expected value, and mathematical reasoning.  
• Trades options and derivatives using models.  
• Reacts quickly to information and adjusts positions instantly.  
• Works closely with researchers and quants to improve models, signals, and pricing logic.

**Quant Trader vs Traditional Trader**  
Traditional trader:  
• May rely more on market intuition, macro views, negotiation, or execution.  
• Often less mathematically rigorous in day-to-day decision-making.

Quant trader:  
• Everything revolves around **modeling**, **statistics**, **probability**, **speed**, **EV calculations**, **pattern recognition**, and **abstraction**.  
• Required to explain decisions mathematically and logically.

**Key Characteristics of the Best Quant Traders**  
• Exceptional mental arithmetic and lightning-fast probability intuition.  
• Comfortable in uncertainty and incomplete information.  
• Strong pattern recognition and game-theoretic reasoning.  
• Calm under pressure.  
• Competitive mindset (chess, poker, robotics, hackathons, strategy games all translate well).  
• Excellent communication: short, clear, structured.  
• Thrives on feedback; rapidly improves.

3. How _You_ Should Introduce Yourself and Frame Your Profile
    

---

This section shows exactly how YOU, with your CV + cover letter background, should present your story in the behavioral interview to match Optiver’s expectations.

### Your Opening Introduction (30–45 seconds)

A tight, clean version tailored for Optiver:

“I’m Karina, a second-year Artificial Intelligence student at VU Amsterdam. I’ve been actively involved in financial markets since I was 14, starting with forex and commodities and later developing systematic equity and event-driven strategies. Over the past years I’ve built and backtested my own trading models, and I manage my own portfolio using structured risk rules and quantitative analysis.

In parallel I’ve worked on technically demanding AI and data-driven projects—such as building algorithmic tools, improving ML systems, and competing in high-pressure hackathons. I enjoy environments where decisions must be fast, logical, and grounded in probability, which is why I’m excited about quantitative trading at Optiver.”

### How to Frame Your Background to Fit Optiver’s Values

Optiver screens for: reasoning, competitive mindset, logic, clear communication.

Your profile hits MANY of their ideal traits. Use them consciously.

Translation for Optiver:  
• Shows curiosity.  
• Shows comfort with markets.  
• Shows iterative learning.

**b. Quant and analytical ability**  
From your AI degree + projects:  
• Probability & statistics  
• Machine learning  
• Data structures & algorithms  
• Logic and sets  
• Time-series analysis  
• Backtesting frameworks

Tell them that these courses gave you a “mental toolkit” for EV-based reasoning and structured problem-solving.

**c. Evidence of high-pressure performance**  
You have:  
• Robotics competitions (FIRST Global)  
• Junction hackathons  
• BR41N.IO EEG hackathon  
• TEDx talk  
• Bootcamp teaching  
These map directly to:  
• Fast decision-making

• Hackathons  
• Robotics competitions  
All show competitiveness + problem-solving.

**e. Show your ability to learn quickly**  
You have a record of picking up new tools fast (Python, ML tools, algorithms, quantitative techniques).  
Tell them: “I learn new concepts quickly and I enjoy environments where improvement happens every day.”

**f. Connect your motivation to _their internship structure_**  
Emphasize:  
• the appeal of simulated trading sessions,  
• direct training from ex-traders,  
• combining research + trading,  
• real-time decision-making.

Optiver was founded in 1986 in Amsterdam by Johann Kaemingk, Ruud Vlek, and Chris Oomen, starting as a market maker in options on the European Options Exchange (now Euronext). The company name merges Dutch words for “option” and “trader,” reflecting its pioneering roots in options trading. Optiver’s operations now span the globe, with trading activities covering equities, bonds, options, futures, ETFs, and other derivatives on over 50 major US, European, and Asian exchanges.[wikipedia+4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optiver)​

Optiver is an industry leader in electronic market making, developing proprietary technology that enables nanosecond trading and ensures liquidity, transparency, and fair markets, even during turbulent conditions. The firm has established itself not only by trading its own capital and managing risk but also by acting as a reliable liquidity provider, helping stabilize markets and enhance their efficiency. Recent developments include a strong financial performance in 2023-2024 and the expansion of their US presence with a new Manhattan office to compete directly with leading market makers like Citadel Securities and Jane Street. Optiver also invests in sustainable initiatives through the Optiver Foundation and puts strong emphasis on diversity and continuous improvement.[optiver+5](https://optiver.com/about-us/)​
