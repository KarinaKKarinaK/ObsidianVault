#### The "tell me about yourself" script
“I’m Karina, a second-year Artificial Intelligence student at VU Amsterdam with a long-standing, practical interest in financial markets. I started trading when I was 14, beginning with forex and commodities and later developing systematic strategies for equities. Over the years, I’ve built and backtested my own models, managed my portfolio using structured risk rules, and focused heavily on probability-based decision making.

Academically, I’ve built strong foundations in statistics, algorithms, machine learning, and logic, which help me think in terms of expected value, uncertainty, and model-driven reasoning. Outside of coursework, I’ve worked on high-pressure technical projects — from hackathons with real-time decision making to robotics competitions — which strengthened my ability to think quickly, communicate clearly, and stay composed under uncertainty.

I enjoy environments where improvement is continuous, feedback is direct, and decisions must be both fast and logical. That’s why Optiver’s approach — especially the combination of trading, research, and hands-on simulated trading — really appeals to me. I’m excited about the chance to learn from experienced traders and apply my quantitative thinking in a real market-making environment.”

### Possible Q&A

Below are **high-quality, Optiver-specific behavioral interview answers**.  
These are not generic HR answers — they are tailored to what Optiver actually evaluates:  
clarity, logic, self-awareness, competitiveness, fast thinking, feedback responsiveness, and probabilistic reasoning.

I’ll give you:  
• The question  
• A polished, structured, Optiver-appropriate answer  
• Notes on why each answer works

---

1. “Tell me about a time you faced a difficult problem and how you solved it.”
    

---

**Answer:**  
“One of the most challenging problems I faced was during the Junction hackathon, where my team had 25 hours to design an AI decision engine for Uber drivers using multiple real-time data sources. The initial model kept failing because our decision logic couldn’t handle conflicting data from events, weather, and flight schedules. I proposed simplifying the problem by breaking it down into probabilistic scenarios — instead of trying to optimize everything at once, we focused on the highest-impact variables and assigned expected values to each decision path.

Once we reframed it this way, the team quickly aligned, and we implemented a decision tree that made real-time recommendations with strong performance. The project ended successfully, and the simplified EV approach became the core of our solution. That experience taught me the value of reducing complexity under time pressure and focusing on decisions with the highest expected impact.”

**Why this works:**  
Optiver loves: EV thinking, breaking complexity into signals, team clarity, pressure performance.

2. “Describe a situation where you had to make a quick decision with limited information.”
    

---

**Answer:**  
“During a robotics competition, our robot suddenly started failing its autonomous routines minutes before a match. We had almost no time to debug. Instead of trying to find the exact bug, I made the call to disable a non-critical module that was likely causing interference and switch to a simplified movement pattern. It wasn’t perfect, but it was reliable.

We won the match because the robot executed consistently, even if suboptimally. That experience reinforced that under uncertainty, a fast, reliable decision is often better than aiming for the perfect solution too late.”

**Why this works:**  
Optiver values fast decision-making, accepting uncertainty, choosing robustness over perfection.

---

3. “Tell me about a time you received critical feedback. How did you respond?”
    

---

**Answer:**  
“In my AI development internship, I received feedback that my early prototypes were overly complex and difficult for the rest of the team to integrate. Instead of defending the design, I asked the reviewer to walk me through the pain points so I could understand exactly where complexity was hurting collaboration.

I refactored the system using a much simpler interface, modularized the components, and documented everything clearly. The next sprint review went much smoother, and the feedback became consistently positive. That experience reinforced how actionable criticism can accelerate learning if you treat it as a data point, not a judgment.”

**Why this works:**  
Optiver tests improvement, humility, speed of correction, and intellectual honesty.

4. “When have you worked in a high-pressure environment? How did you handle it?”
    

---

**Answer:**  
“In the BR41N.IO hackathon, we had only 24 hours to build a functional EEG-based interaction system. EEG signals are noisy and unpredictable, and our first pipeline completely failed during live testing. The team started panicking, but I focused on isolating one reliable pattern we could consistently detect and built a minimal model around that instead of the full feature set.

By narrowing the scope, we produced a stable demo that worked every time. In high-pressure environments, I prioritize stability, simplify the decision space, and keep everyone aligned on the most achievable path.”

**Why this works:**  
Optiver wants people who stay calm, think clearly, simplify, and deliver under time pressure.

5. “Why Optiver?”
    

---

**Answer:**  
“I’m drawn to Optiver because it combines three things that strongly motivate me: fast, probabilistic decision-making, rigorous feedback loops, and an environment where improvement is measurable every day. I’ve been trading since I was 14, and the mental models I’ve built — expected value thinking, pattern recognition, risk-aware decision making — align naturally with how Optiver approaches trading.

The internship’s structure, with simulated trading, research integration, and direct mentorship from experienced traders, matches exactly how I learn best: hands-on, with immediate feedback. It feels like the ideal environment to push my quantitative thinking and decision-making skills to their limit.”

**Why this works:**  
Shows: EV orientation, long-term interest in markets, alignment with Optiver culture.

6. “Describe a time when you had to work in a team to achieve a goal.”
    

---

**Answer:**  
“In the FIRST Global robotics competitions, our team had to design both the mechanical and software components under strict time constraints. We often had conflicting opinions on strategy, especially when performance wasn’t improving. I helped mediate by turning the debate into a set of measurable tests — instead of arguing, we ran controlled trials comparing each idea.

Once the results were quantified, decisions became straightforward, and we improved the robot’s performance significantly. That experience taught me the value of replacing subjective discussions with objective data, especially in a collaborative and high-pressure setting.”

**Why this works:**  
Optiver loves structured reasoning, testing ideas, reducing subjectivity.

---

7. “How do you deal with uncertainty?”
    

---

**Answer:**  
“I approach uncertainty by breaking a problem into scenarios, assigning rough probabilities, and identifying the highest-EV action. I’ve applied this both in trading — managing entries and exits under incomplete information — and in technical projects where inputs were inconsistent.

Even when the probabilities aren’t precise, framing decisions this way keeps me from overreacting emotionally or getting stuck. It helps me move quickly while still being logically grounded.”

**Why this works:**  
This is EXACTLY the mindset of a market maker: scenario → probability → EV.

---

8. “What motivates you?”
    

---

**Answer:**  
“I’m motivated by environments where the feedback is fast, the stakes are real, and performance depends on clear reasoning rather than hierarchy or subjective judgment. That’s why trading appeals to me — you see immediately whether your logic holds up, and improvement is measurable.

I also enjoy competitive, problem-solving settings — hackathons, trading simulations, and robotics competitions — where strategy, speed, and adaptability all matter.”

**Why this works:**  
Optiver values competitiveness, logic, improvement, and feedback orientation.
