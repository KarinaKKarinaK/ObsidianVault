## Part I: Genetic and Biological Basis of Behaviour (Topics 1–8)

### Topic 1: Genes and Evolution

**1. Definitions and Core Concepts**

- **Psychological Science:** The scientific study of **mind, brain, and behaviour**.
- **Nature vs. Nurture:** Psychology currently operates on the principle that **genes and environment continuously interact** to determine outcomes. Who we are is determined by how our genes are expressed in distinct environments.
- **Genome:** The **complete set of instructions** for making an organism, containing all its genes.
- **Genotype:** An organism’s **specific set of genes**. Monozygotic (identical) twins have the same genotype.
- **Phenotype:** The **overt traits and behaviours** of an organism, determined by the interaction of genotype and environment.
- **Allele:** One specific variant of a gene.
    - **Homozygote:** Alleles on the locus are the same.
    - **Heterozygote:** Alleles on the locus are different.
    - For a property to be recessively inherited, it **must be passed by both parents to express itself in the phenotype**.

**2. Gene Expression and Environment**

- **Gene Expression:** Whether a gene is turned "on" or "off". In each cell, some genes are expressed and others are not.
- The **biochemical environment inside the cell** controls gene expression [12, 316 (Q3)]. This environment is influenced by the overall environment, timing in development, experience, and behaviour.
- **Methylation:** A chemical reaction where a small molecule (methyl group) is added to DNA or proteins, providing an explanation of **environmental influence on genes**.

**3. Evolution by Natural Selection**

- **Variation among individuals** of a population is an **essential condition for evolutionary change** [17, 315 (Q1)].
- **Natural Selection:** The key mechanism of evolution.
    - Individuals with a certain trait survive and reproduce at higher rates.
    - The advantageous trait is passed from parents to offspring, becoming better represented in the next generation.

### Topic 2: The Brain and the Nervous System

**1. Building Blocks and Communication**

- The nervous system consists of **Glia** and **Neurons**.
- **Types of Neurons:** Sensory (afferent, conveying signals towards the brain), Motor (efferent, conveying directions towards the muscles), and Interneurons.
- **Action Potential:** A neural impulse (brief electrical charge) that travels down an axon, governed by the **All-or-none law** (a neuron either fires or does not fire). Intensity variations are signalled by the number of neurons firing and the firing rate (frequency).
- **Synapse:** The place where a signal passes from one nerve cell to another.
- **Neurotransmitters (NTs):** Chemical substances that transmit signals across the synapse.
    - The binding of an NT with a receptor produces an **excitatory or inhibitory signal**.
    - An excitatory effect lowers the potential difference between the inside and outside of the postsynaptic neuron [319 (Q8)].
    - NT effects are terminated by autoreceptors, synaptic reuptake, or enzyme deactivation.

**2. Nervous System Divisions**

- The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) consists of the **Somatic and the Autonomic Nervous System** (ANS) [318 (Q7)].
- **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):** Regulates involuntary functions.
    - **Sympathetic Nervous System:** **Arouses the body** (mobilizing energy in stressful situations, e.g., increased heart rate and blood flow to muscles).
    - **Parasympathetic Nervous System:** **Calms the body** (conserves energy, e.g., digestive processes).
    - _Example:_ During a nap, the Parasympathetic NS is active; during a fight, the Sympathetic NS is active [317-318 (Q6)].
- **Drugs:** **Agonists enhance NT action** (e.g., increasing precursor, blocking reuptake, or **mimicking the neurotransmitter’s action** [33, 320 (Q10)]). Antagonists inhibit NT action (e.g., blocking receptors).

**3. Brain Structure and Lateralization**

- **Cerebral Cortex Lobes:**
    - **Frontal Lobe:** Personality, planning, emotion, problem-solving, and the **Motor Cortex**. Stimulation of the primary motor projection area (Motor Cortex) would cause movement. Since the Motor Cortex controls the opposite side of the body, stimulation causing the **left leg** to move must have occurred in the **right Frontal lobe** [319, 320 (Q9)].
    - **Parietal Lobe:** Touch (Somatosensory Cortex).
    - **Temporal Lobe:** Hearing and Wernicke's area (language comprehension).
    - **Occipital Lobe:** Vision (Visual Cortex).
- **Plasticity:** The brain’s capacity for modification and reorganization following injury or experience.
- **Hemispheric Specialization (Lateralization):** The left hemisphere handles language and logic, while the right hemisphere handles spatial ability, emotion (facial expressions), and musical ability.
- **Split-Brain Experiments:** Show that the left hemisphere can verbalize what it has seen, but the right hemisphere can only show it (e.g., pointing with the left hand).

**4. Studying the Brain (Methods)**

- Methods include clinical observation (e.g., Phineas Gage), invasive techniques (lesions, single-cell recordings in animals), and experimental techniques.
- **Electrophysiology:** Records electrical activity. **EEG (Electroencephalogram)** and ERP are examples [29, 283, 320 (Q11)].
- **Brain Imaging:** Techniques like fMRI and PET scan map brain activity.

### Topic 3: Consciousness

**1. Defining Consciousness**

- **Consciousness:** Subjective awareness of ourselves and our environment. It is one’s subjective experience of the world, resulting from brain activity.
- **Qualia:** The subjective or qualitative properties of experiences.
- **Global Workspace Model:** Consciousness arises as a function of which brain circuits are active.

**2. Variations in Consciousness**

- **Automatic vs. Controlled Processing:** Consciousness is more controlled/focused when learning complex concepts but **becomes automatic by practice**. Automatic processes **do not need awareness** [320 (Q12)].
- **Attention:** The process that enables selective focus.
    - **Cocktail Party Phenomenon:** The ability to selectively attend to one voice among many, though unattended information may sometimes break through.
    - **Shadowing (Dichotic Listening):** A technique where a participant repeats back **words heard in one ear** [46, 321 (Q13)].
    - **Change Blindness:** Failing to notice changes without much awareness.
- **Sleep:** An altered state of consciousness where conscious experience of the outside world is largely turned off. The statement that the brain shuts down during sleep is **not correct** [322 (Q15)].
    - **Sleep Theories:** Include Restorative theory, Circadian rhythm theory, and Facilitation of learning theory.
    - **Dreams:** Products of an altered state; REM dreams are bizarre and intense, while Non-REM dreams are dull.

### Topic 4: Sensation and Perception: Vision

**1. Sensation vs. Perception**

- **Sensation:** The **detection of external stimuli** and the transmission of this information to the brain.
- **Perception:** The **processing, organization, and interpretation** of sensory signals.
- **The Pathway:** Distal Stimulus → Proximal Stimulus → Transduction → Sensation → Perception.

**2. Thresholds and Sensory Systems**

- **Absolute Threshold:** The minimum stimulus energy needed to detect a stimulus **50% of the time**.
- **Difference Threshold (JND):** The minimum difference between two stimuli required for detection 50% of the time, described by **Weber’s law**.
- **Sensory Adaptation:** The tendency to respond less to an unchanging stimulus, occurring at the level of sensory receptors.
- **Senses:** Vision, Hearing, Taste, Smell, Skin senses (pressure, temp, pain), Vestibular sense (balance), Kinesthesia, and Proprioception.

**3. Vision and the Retina**
![[Pasted image 20251014192036.png]]
![[Pasted image 20251014192142.png]]
- **Pathway:** Light → Cornea → Pupil, Iris → Lens → **Retina** → Optic nerve → Brain’s visual cortex.
- **Photoreceptors:**
    - **Rods:** Responsible for night vision (low light) and no colour vision.
    - **Cones:** Responsible for day vision and colour vision.
- In the retina, there are **no cones and rods where the optic nerve exits the eye** (the blind spot) [323 (Q17)].
- **Colour Vision Theories:**
    - **Trichromatic Theory (Young-Helmholz):** Based on three cone types.
    - **Opponent-process theory (Hering):** Explains afterimages and involves opposing pairs (Red-Green, Blue-Yellow, Black-White).

**4. Visual Perception**

- **Processing Models:**
    - **Bottom-up processing (data-driven):** Starts at sensory receptors and works up to higher processing.
    - **Top-down processing (knowledge-driven):** Uses experience and expectations (e.g., priming, context) to construct perceptions.
- **Visual Streams:** After the retina, visual information splits into two systems:
    - **"What" pathway (Ventral):** Path to the temporal cortex (object recognition).
    - **"Where" pathway (Dorsal):** Path to the **parietal cortex** (spatial location). This corresponds to the **Where system** [324, 325 (Q20)].
- **Perceptual Organization (Gestalt Principles):**
    - **Proximity:** Grouping stimuli that are physically close together [66, 324 (Q19)].
    - **Similarity** *(The tendency to group items that **resemble each other** (e.g., in colour, shape, size, or orientation)*
    - **Continuity** *(the tendency to perceive lines or shapes as following the **smoothest path**, even when they are interrupted or overlapped by other shapes)*, and 
	    - **Closure** *(The tendency to perceive shapes and figures as **complete** even if there are gaps or missing information. The brain "fills in" the missing contours to perceive a whole form)* are also key principles.
- **Depth Perception:** Uses cues.
    - **Binocular cues:** Rely on both eyes (e.g., **Binocular disparity**—difference in images seen by each eye, and **Convergence**). An increase in the distance between eyes would cause an **increase in binocular disparity** [323, 324 (Q18)].
    - **Monocular cues:** Rely on one eye (e.g., Occlusion, Linear perspective, Texture gradients, Motion parallax).
- **Perceptual Constancies:** Correctly perceiving different properties of distal stimuli despite continuously changing proximal stimuli (e.g., Size, Shape, Lightness, Color constancy).

### Topic 5: Learning

**1. Non-Associative Learning**

- **Habituation:** A **decrease** in an innate response to a frequently repeated stimulus, allowing better focus on new stimuli [71, 290, 326 (Q24)].
- **Sensitization:** An **increased response** to a stimulus after repeated exposure.

**2. Classical Conditioning (Pavlovian)**

- A form of associative learning where a **neutral stimulus (CS) comes to elicit a response when associated with a stimulus (US) that already produces that response**.
    - **Unconditioned Stimulus (US):** Naturally triggers a response (e.g., food).
    - **Unconditioned Response (UR):** Natural, unlearned reaction (e.g., salivation to food).
    - **Conditioned Stimulus (CS):** Previously neutral, now elicits a response (e.g., bell).
    - **Conditioned Response (CR):** Learned response to the CS.
- The knee reflex (lower leg movement after a tap) is an innate movement, making it an example of an **Unconditioned response (UR)** [325 (Q21)].
- Classical conditioning requires **Contiguity** (CS presented before US) and **Contingency** (CS should be informative about the US occurrence).
- **Extinction:** Eliminating the CR by repeatedly presenting the CS alone.
- **Spontaneous Recovery:** CR returns after extinction and a rest interval.
- **Stimulus Generalization:** CR elicited by stimuli similar to the CS.
- **Cognitivist View:** The CS functions as a predictor of the US, and the CR is a reaction in preparation for the US.

**3. Operant Conditioning (Instrumental Conditioning)**

- Learning based on the **consequence of an action/response** determining the likelihood it will be performed again. Learned is the relationship between **response and reward/punishment** [77, 325 (Q22)].
- **Law of Effect (Thorndike):** Performance is strengthened if followed by a reward and weakened if not.
- **Reinforcers (Increase behaviour):**
    - **Positive Reinforcement:** Adding pleasant stimulus.
    - **Negative Reinforcement:** Removing unpleasant stimulus.
- **Punishment (Decrease behaviour):** Positive (adding unpleasant) and Negative (removing pleasant) punishment.
- **Shaping:** Reinforcing **successive approximations** of a behaviour.
- **Schedules of Reinforcement:**
    - **Continuous Reinforcement:** Every instance is rewarded (fast learning, **fastest extinction**) [80, 293, 326 (Q23)].
    - **Partial Reinforcement:** Rewards are intermittent, leading to the **partial-reinforcement extinction effect**, meaning resistance to extinction is higher than with continuous reinforcement.
    - **Ratio schedules (FR, VR):** Based on number of responses.
    - **Interval schedules (FI, VI):** Based on time elapsed.
- **Latent Learning (Tolman):** Learning that occurs in the absence of reinforcement, often resulting in a **Cognitive map**.
- **Learned Helplessness:** Results from lack of contingency between response and consequence.

**4. Observational Learning**

- **Observational learning (Social learning):** Acquisition or modification of behaviour after exposure to another individual performing that behaviour.
- **Modeling:** Performing the observed behaviour.
- **Vicarious learning:** Learning by watching others receive reinforcement or punishment.
- **Mirror Neurons:** Neural mechanisms implicated in observational learning.

### Topic 6: Memory

**1. Memory Systems and Phases**

- Memory is the nervous system’s capacity to retain and retrieve skills and knowledge.
- **Three Phases of Memory:**
    1. **Encoding:** Transforming stimuli into a storable format.
    2. **Storage and Consolidation:** Retention in memory traces.
    3. **Retrieval:** Accessing stored information (recall or recognition).

**2. Atkinson-Shiffrin Model (Stage Theory)**

- **Sensory Memory:** Fleeting storage.
    - **Iconic memory:** Momentary visual memory (few tenths of a second).
    - **Echoic memory:** Momentary auditory memory (3–4 seconds).
- **Short-Term Memory (STM) / Working Memory:** Limited capacity ("magic number seven"). Items disappear due to **decay and replacement**.
    - The back-counting task used during the interval between presentation and recall is used because it **overwrites the contents of working memory** [326, 327 (Q25)].
    - Capacity can be expanded by **recoding (chunks)**.
- **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** Unlimited capacity.

**3. Types of LTM (Varieties of Memory)**

- **Explicit (Declarative) Memory:** Conscious retention of facts and experiences. The name of a primary school teacher is stored in **long-term memory** and requires **explicit** recall [327, 328 (Q27)].
- **Implicit (Nondeclarative) Memory:** Unconscious retention of skills or conditioned associations.

**4. Encoding, Storage, and Retrieval**

- **Depth of Processing:**
    - **Shallow processing:** Surface form (poor recall).
    - **Deep processing (Semantic encoding):** Encoding meaning (results in better recognition).
- **Consolidation:** Neural process stabilizing memory into a permanent state. **Sleep supports consolidation**.
- **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP):** Strengthening of a synaptic connection.
- **Retrieval Cues:** Effective cues re-create the context (**context reinstatement**) or state of mind.
- **Interference:** A cause of forgetting.
    - **Retroactive Interference:** When information learned later (new) decreases the probability of remembering previously learned information (old) [100, 328 (Q26)].
    - **Proactive Interference:** Old information hinders new information.

**5. Memory Failure and Distortion**

- **Absentmindedness:** Inattentive or shallow encoding.
- **Memory Decay:** Forgetting over time (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve).
- **Memory Bias:** Changing memories to be consistent with current beliefs.
- **Suggestibility/Misinformation Effect (Loftus):** Memories are distorted by misleading information or question wording.

### Topic 7: Thinking and Language

**1. Mental Representations**

- **Analogical Representations:** Share characteristics with the physical object. Unlike perceptual images, mental images **cannot easily be reinterpreted** [328, 329 (Q28)].
- **Symbolic Representations:** Abstract representations (e.g., words).
- **Categorization:**
    - **Prototype Theory (Rosch):** Category membership depends on similarity to an "average" representation (prototype).
    - **Exemplar Theory (Nosofsky):** Category membership depends on similarity to specific, real examples (exemplars).

**2. Decision Making and Heuristics**

- **Normative Decision Theories:** Define how people **should** make decisions (e.g., Expected Utility Theory: maximise outcome).
- **Descriptive Decision Theories:** Indicate how people **actually** make choices.
- **Heuristics:** Mental shortcuts used to reduce thinking, which can result in faulty decisions.
    - **Anchoring:** Relying on the first piece of information encountered.
    - **Framing:** Tendency to emphasize potential losses or gains.
    - **Availability Heuristic:** Deciding based on the answer that most easily comes to mind.
    - **Representativeness Heuristic:** Deciding based on how typical an individual, object, or event belongs in a certain category. Max's judgment about New Zealanders based on one friendly person is based on the **representativeness heuristic** [329 (Q29)].
    - **Affective Forecasting Heuristic:** Overestimating how events will make them feel in the future.
- **Satisficers vs. Maximizers:** A good strategy is to satisfice (find a 'good enough' option) rather than optimize (find the best option).

**3. Problem Solving**

- The thinking process of moving from an initial state to a goal state.
- **Obstacles:**
    - **Mental Set:** Sticking to established strategies.
    - **Functional Fixedness:** Having fixed ideas about the typical functions of objects.
- **Overcoming Obstacles:** Formulate **subgoals**, **restructuring** the problem, using an **algorithm** (guarantees a solution), using an **analogy**, or waiting for a sudden **insight**. To solve a difficult problem, one needs to **encourage the person to use analogies** [330 (Q30)].

**4. Language**

- **Language:** A system using sounds and symbols according to grammatical rules.
    - **Syntax:** Grammatical rules.
    - **Semantics:** Meanings.
- **Aphasia:** Language disorders resulting in deficits in comprehension or production.
    - **Expressive Aphasia (Broca’s aphasia):** Interruption of the ability to **speak**.
    - **Receptive Aphasia (Wernicke’s aphasia):** Difficulties understanding the meaning of words (comprehension).

### Topic 8: Intelligence

**1. Definitions and Measurement**

- **Intelligence (Gottfredson, 1997):** "The ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience".
- **Historical Figures:** Galton (statistical analysis), Pearson (covariation), Spearman (general intelligence), Binet (mental age, used to assess schoolchildren), Stern (IQ calculation).
- **IQ (Intelligence Quotient):** Calculated as **(Mental Age / Chronological Age) x 100**.
    - Judi (MA 9, CA 6) has an IQ of (9/6) * 100 = **150 points** [330, 331 (Q31)].
- **Intelligence Tests:** Binet/Stanford-Binet, Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC/WAIS-R), Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), and Raven’s Progressive Matrices Test.

**2. Theories of Intelligence (Psychometric Approach)**

- The psychometric approach attempts to understand intelligence by studying patterns in test results.
- **Spearman (1904):** Proposed a model with **general intelligence ($g$)** and **specific abilities**. Intercorrelations between WAIS-R subtests are not perfect because **there are specific intelligence factors** [332 (Q33)].
- **Cattell (1971):** Distinguished between **fluid intelligence** (solving new problems) and **crystallized intelligence** (knowledge from prior learning).

**3. Intelligence Beyond IQ**

- Standard tests often fail to capture other types of intelligence.
    - **Sternberg (1999):** Analytic, Creative, and Practical intelligence.
    - **Gardner (1983):** Multiple intelligences (linguistic, spatial, musical, etc.).

**4. Roots of Intelligence (Nature and Nurture)**

- **Heritability ($H$):** A statistical estimate of the proportion of variance in a population trait due to genetics.
    - When the heritability ratio is high, behaviour is **predominantly determined by genetic factors** [332 (Q34)].
    - Heritability is not fate and can change if the environment changes.
- **Genetic Influences:** Supported by twin studies (identical twins correlate highly, $r=.86$) and adoption studies.
- **Environmental Influences:** Include SES, education, and enriched environments.
- **Flynn Effect:** The steady rise in IQ scores across generations, attributed to environmental factors.

## Part II: Scientific Research Methods (Topics 9–14)

### Topic 9: Scientific Reasoning

**1. Logic and Fixation of Belief**

- **Belief:** An attitude towards a claim; there is **no direct connection between belief and truth**.
- **Methods to Fix Belief (Non-scientific):** Personal experience, intuition, and authority.
- **Scientific Method:** Fixes belief based on **empirical research** by combining proper reasoning (logic) and systematic empiricism (verifiable evidence).
- Science deals only with **solvable problems**.
- A scientific belief is justified if it is based on the **correct application of the scientific method** [334 (Q37)].

**2. Reasoning Types and the Empirical Cycle**

- **Deduction (Top-down):** General rule/theory predicts specific outcome; conclusion is inescapable. Used to formulate a prediction from a hypothesis [334, 335 (Q38)].
- **Induction (Bottom-up):** Specific observations lead to a general rule/theory. Used to formulate a hypothesis from data [334, 335 (Q38)].
- **Empirical Cycle (Theory-Data Cycle):** Theory → Hypothesis → Prediction → Data → Induction (Theory refinement).

**3. Conditional Arguments (Syllogisms)**

- **Valid Arguments (Deduction):**
    - **Affirming the antecedent (Modus Ponens):** If A then B. A. Thus B.
    - **Denying the consequent (Modus Tollens):** **If A then B. Not B. Thus, not A**. This is the correct conclusion for the argument "If P then Q, not Q" [335 (Q39)].
- **Invalid Arguments:** Affirming the consequent and Denying the antecedent.

**4. Falsifiability**

- **Hypothesis:** A **testable prediction** derived from a theory.
- **Falsifiability Criterion (Popper):** To be scientific, a hypothesis must be **potentially falsifiable**; it must generate predictions that might not be true.
- **Conditions for a Good Test:** A good test of a hypothesis (H) requires two conditions [161, 333 (Q36)]:
    1. If [H and Initial Conditions (IC) and Auxiliary Assumptions (AA)] then **Prediction (P)** (Deduction).
    2. If [**not-H** and IC and AA] then very probably **not-P** (Induction needed to support H). (Option B in Q36 is the correct statement).

### Topic 10: Validity

**1. Claims and Variables**

- **Psychology Goals:** Describe, predict, explain/understand, and influence/control behaviour.
- **Three Claims:**
    - **Frequency Claims:** Focus on one variable (descriptive research).
    - **Association Claims:** Focus on the relationship between two variables (correlational research).
    - **Causal Claims:** Focus on causation (experimental research).
- **Variables:**
    - **Conceptual Variable (Construct):** Abstract, theoretical level (e.g., anxiety).
    - **Operational Variable:** The specific way a construct is manipulated or measured in a study.
    - **Independent Variable (IV):** The variable that is **manipulated** (presumed cause) [175, 223, 335 (Q40)].
    - **Dependent Variable (DV):** The variable that is **measured** (presumed effect).
    - **Confounding Variables:** Variables that change simultaneously with the IV.
    - **Control Variables:** Variables held constant on purpose.

**2. Types of Validity**

- **Validity:** The appropriateness of a claim (reasonable, accurate, justifiable).
- **Construct Validity (Q43):** How well a conceptual variable is measured or manipulated. A good **operational definition** is particularly important for construct validity.
    - _Threats:_ Inadequate operational definition (e.g., test measuring anxiety vs. self-confidence).
- **External Validity:** How well results generalize to other individuals, settings, places, and times (contexts).
- **Internal Validity (Q44):** The extent to which alternative explanations for a causal relationship can be ruled out (high internal validity is key for causal claims).
    - An **experimental study** generally has the greatest internal validity because it manipulates the IV and controls confounds.
    - _Threats:_ Design confounds, Maturation, History, Testing, Instrumentation, Regression to the mean, Attrition, and Selection effects.
- **Statistical Validity:** How accurate and reasonable the statistical conclusions are (focuses on effect size and significance).

_Example of Validity Trade-off (Q42):_ An experiment using rats (high control) typically has **high internal validity** (it is easy to rule out confounds) but **low external validity** (results may not generalize to humans).

### Topic 11: Measurement, Reliability, and Descriptive Research

**1. Measurement Scales**

- Measurement is a systematic way to assign numbers or names to objects and their features.
- **Nominal Scale:** Differences (categorical).
- **Ordinal Scale:** Ranked order.
- **Interval Scale:** Equal intervals (addition/subtraction possible, but no true zero).
- **Ratio Scale (Q45):** Has an **absolute zero** (ratios are meaningful).
- The measurement scale determines possible statistical operations and conclusions.

**2. Reliability**

- **Reliability:** The **consistency** of measurements. Observed Score = True Score + Error Score.
- **Types of Reliability:**
    - **Test-retest reliability:** Consistency over time.
    - **Internal reliability:** Consistency across different items within a measure (e.g., Split-half reliability, Cronbach's alpha).
    - **Interrater reliability:** Consistency across different observers.
    - **Experimental reliability**.

**3. Descriptive Research**

- **Purpose:** To describe behaviour and mental processes. It yields **frequency claims**.
- **Types:** Observational research (naturalistic or lab), Surveys, and Case studies.
- **Observational Research Problems:** Observer bias, observer effects, and reactivity. Low internal validity.
- **Surveys/Polls:** Posing questions to people. Threats to construct validity include leading questions, double-barrelled questions, and negatively worded questions.
- **External Validity Threat:** Biased or unrepresentative sample (e.g., convenience or self-selection).

### Topic 12: Correlations and Experiments

**1. Correlational Research**

- Correlational research yields **association claims**.
- **Correlation Coefficient ($r$):** A measure of the degree of **linear relation** between two variables, ranging from -1.00 (perfect negative) to +1.00 (perfect positive). Absolute value indicates strength; sign indicates direction.
- _Example:_ Scatter diagram showing data points scattered randomly across the plane indicates a correlation of **about 0** [338 (Q46)].
- **Causation vs. Correlation:** Correlation indicates association but **does not indicate causality**.
    - **Directionality Problem (Temporal Precedence):** Unknown direction of causation.
    - **Third-Variable Problem:** A third, unmeasured variable causes the association (**spurious correlation**).

**2. Establishing Temporal Precedence (Advanced Correlational Techniques)**

- **Cross-Lagged-Panel Procedure:** Measures variables over time. Variable A affects Variable B if the correlation between **Variable A measured at time 1 and Variable B measured at time 2 is larger** than the correlation between Variable A measured at time 1 and Variable B measured at time 1 (which only measures the relationship at the initial time point) [214, 338, 339 (Q47)].

**3. Experimental Research**

- An experiment creates a comparison by manipulating one variable while holding others constant. It yields **causal claims**.
- **Causal Criteria:** Covariance, Temporal Precedence, and **Internal Validity**.
- **Null Results:** When the IV does not affect the DV, possible explanations include weak manipulation, insensitive measures, unreliable measurements, low power, or **Ceiling/Floor effects**.

### Topic 13: Single-Factor and Factorial Designs

**1. Experimental Designs**

- **Between-subjects design (Independent-groups):** Separate groups of subjects receive different levels of the IV.
    - _Advantage:_ No chance that one IV level affects performance under another level.
    - _Disadvantage:_ Chance that groups differ. Controlled by **random assignment** or **matching**.
    - In a between-subjects design, there is no chance on **carry-over effects** but there is a chance on **group differences** [340 (Q49)].
- **Within-subjects design (Repeated-measures):** All subjects receive all levels of the IV.
    - _Advantage:_ Each subject serves as their own control (no group differences).
    - _Disadvantage:_ Chance of **order effects** (practice, carryover).
    - _Solution:_ **Counterbalancing** (Complete counterbalanced design, Latin Square design, Balanced Latin Square design, Random order).
    - A study with 4 IV levels using a balanced Latin Square design requires at least **4 subjects** [233, 342 (Q51)].

**2. Factorial Designs**

- Involves **two or more independent variables (factors)**.
- **Factorial Combination:** Each level of every IV occurs with all levels of the other IV(s).
- **Notation:** A 5 x 2 factorial between-subjects design has two factors with 5 and 2 levels, resulting in $5 \times 2 = \mathbf{10}$ groups/conditions [236, 342 (Q52)].
- **Advantages:** Efficiency, generalization, and providing information on the **interaction between factors**.
- **Effects:**
    - **Main Effect:** The overall effect of **one IV** on the DV, averaged over the levels of the other IV(s).
    - **Interaction Effect:** Occurs when the effect of one IV **depends on the level of the other IV(s)**.
        - Graphically, **no interaction** means the lines are **parallel**. If the lines are not parallel, there is an interaction.

**3. Interpreting Factorial Results (Q53-55)**

- **Q53 Analysis:**
    - Line A is flat (no effect of A).
    - Line B1 is higher than B2 (main effect of B).
    - The lines are not parallel (interaction A x B).
    - Conclusion: **No effect of A; a main effect of B; an interaction between A and B**.
- **Q54 Analysis:**
    - Averages for A1 and A2 are different (main effect of A).
    - Averages for B1 and B2 are different (main effect of B).
    - The lines are parallel (no interaction).
    - Conclusion: **A main effect of A; a main effect of B; no interaction between A and B**.
- **Q55 Analysis (Data Table):**
    - Mean A1 = (4+6)/2 = 5; Mean A2 = (4+6)/2 = 5 (No main effect of A).
    - Mean B1 = (4+4)/2 = 4; Mean B2 = (6+6)/2 = 6 (Main effect of B).
    - Difference at A1: 4-6 = -2; Difference at A2: 4-6 = -2. The effect of B does not depend on A (No interaction).
    - Conclusion: **No effect of A; a main effect of B; no interaction between A and B**.

### Topic 14: Small-N and Quasi-Experimental Designs

**1. Quasi-Experimental Designs**

- Experiments in which the experimenter **selects** rather than manipulates the independent variables (e.g., subject variables like age or environmental variables like a lockdown).
- **Lack of Control:** Quasi-experiments often lack random assignment.
- **Internal Validity:** Internal validity is **not as high as in a true experiment** because confounds are harder to rule out. A disadvantage compared to a true factorial design is a **lower internal validity** [344 (Q56)].
- **Types:**
    - **Pretest/posttest design (AB design):** O1 - T - O2.
    - **Nonequivalent control group pretest/posttest design:** Uses a non-randomly selected control group. When using a non-equivalent control group, it is important to **match both groups with respect to possible contaminating variables** [258, 346 (Q59)].
    - **Interrupted time-series design:** O1 O2 O3... T ... O6 O7 O8....

**2. Small-N Studies**

- Involve intensive study of a very small number of participants.
- Often aim to generate causal claims.
- **Types:**
    - **Stable-baseline design (AB Design):** A (baseline) followed by B (treatment). Finding a difference between A and B does not necessarily prove causality due to potential confounds (e.g., maturation, history) [344 (Q57)].
    - **Reversal design (ABA or ABAB Design):** Introduction and withdrawal of treatment to confirm effect.
    - **Multiple-baseline design:** Treatment introduced at different times across behaviours, settings, or individuals.

**3. Threats in Experimental Designs**

- **Ceiling Effect (Q58):** Occurs when all participants score too high on the dependent variable, obscuring any differences between conditions. In the problem-solving example, since 98% and 99% of children solved the puzzle, the measure was too easy, resulting in a **ceiling effect**.
- **Floor Effect:** Occurs when all scores are too low.
- **Regression to the mean:** Expected return to normal following extremely high or low initial scores.
- **Person Variable:** A variable inherent to the participant (e.g., age, sex, memory skills). **Calculation instructions** is a variable that is manipulated or measured external to the person, not a person variable [346 (Q60)].
