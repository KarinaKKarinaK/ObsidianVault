## 1. Agent Architectures & Design Patterns (beyond ReAct)

You covered ReAct — next:

- **Plan-and-Execute agents**
    
- **Tree of Thoughts (ToT) / Graph of Thoughts (GoT)**
    
- **Reflexion (self-critique + memory)**
    
- **AutoGPT / BabyAGI style loop architectures**
    
- **Hierarchical agents (manager–worker)**
    
- **Role-based multi-agent systems**
    
- **Debate & voting agents**
    

Why: These define _how intelligence is structured_, not just what tools are used.
